    "# Module 4: Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Evaluation is an integral component of any data analytics project. It helps to find out how well the model will work on predicting future(out-of-sample) data. This module introduces basic model evaluation metrics for machine learning algorithms. First, the evaluation metrics for regression is presented. Next the metrics and technics to evaluate classification are introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "#### By the end of this module, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- understand the evaluation metrics for regression,\n",
    "- understand the evalueation metrics for classification,\n",
    "- calculate and display values of the evaluation metrics with python code, and\n",
    "- plot ROC curve for classification models.\n",
