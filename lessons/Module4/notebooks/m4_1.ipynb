    "\n",
    "This lesson introduces basic evaluation metrics and technics to evaluate regression models. The metrics introduced in this lesson include Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Mean Squared Error(MSE), Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE) and R-squared($R^2$) aka Coefficient of Determination. We will also demonstrate how to plot residual vs. observed plot for a regression model and how to interpret the plot.\n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "- articulate the concept of MAE, MSE, RMSE and R-squared and how to calcluate them,\n",
    "- extract and print the metric values for regression models with python, and\n",
    "- plot residual vs. observed plot and evaluate models based on the plot.\n",
