    "In this notebook, we introduce the concept of [_bagging_][wbag], which is shorthand for bootstrap aggregation, where random samples of the data are used to construct multiple decision trees. Since each tree only sees part of the data, each tree is less accurate than if it had been constructed over the full data set. Thus, each tree is known as a _weak learner_. A more powerful, meta-estimator is subsequently constructed by averaging over these many weak learners. The approach of constructing weak learners, and combining them into a more powerful estimator is at the heart of several, very powerful machine learning techniques, among which, the most popular one is the [random forest][wrf].\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the simplest machine learning algorithms to understand is the decision tree. Often, a decision tree is made as large as possible to provide the best predictive model, as this produces a high purity in the leaf nodes. Doing so, however, can lead to **overfitting** where the model predicts very accurately on the training data but fails to generalize to the test data; and where the accuracy is, as a result, much lower. \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple approach to overcoming the overfitting problem is to train many decision trees on a subset of the data and to average the resulting predictions. This process is known as bootstrap aggregation, which is often shortened to bagging. Of these two terms, aggregation is simple to understand, one simply aggregates (or, in particular, averages) the predictions of the many trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "The term bootstrap is a statistical term that defines how a sample can be constructed from an original data set. Given a data set, there are two simple ways to construct a new sample. As a specific example, consider building a list of shows you wish to watch from an online provider like Netflix or Amazon by placing them in virtual cart. In the first approach, you take a show off the virtual shelf and place it in your cart, the show is no longer available on the shelf. This is known as sampling without replacement since the show is only present in your cart. In the second approach, you take a show and place it in your cart, but there remains a copy of the show on the virtual shelf and others can still pick it. This is known as sampling with replacement, since we replace the original instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling with replacement has several advantages that make it important for machine learning. First, we can construct many large samples from our original data set, where each sample is not limited by the size of the original data set. For example, if our original data set contained 100 entries, sampling without replacement would mean we could only create ten new samples that each had ten entries. On the other hand, sampling with replacement means we could create 100 (or more) new samples that each have ten (or more) entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building many samples from a parent population allows us to build an estimator on each sample and average (or aggregate) the results. This is demonstrated in the following figure, where an original data set is used to train a number of decision trees. In this case, each tree is constructed from a bootstrap sample of the original data set. The predictions from these trees are aggregated at the end to make a final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Decision Trees Image](images/dt-rjb-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The scikit learn library provides a bagging meta-estimator, that can generate bootstrap samples, apply a standard estimator (including other algorithms beyond a decision tree), and aggregate the resulting predictions. This technique can be used for classification tasks ([`BaggingClassifier`][skbc]) or for regression ([`BaggingRegressor`][skbr])\n",
    "\n",
    "These estimators have several hyperparameters that control their performance:\n",
    "- `base_estimator`: The estimator to use on each sample, by default this is a decision tree.\n",
    "- `n_estimators`: The number of base estimators to create for the ensemble, by default this is ten.\n",
    "- `max_samples` : The number of instances to draw from the parent population to train each base estimator, by default this is one.\n",
    "- `max_features`: The number of features to draw from the  parent population to train each base estimator, by default this is one.\n",
    "\n",
    "This bagging estimator allows different basic algorithms, beyond the decision tree, to be used for ensemble learning. For the rest of the notebook, however, we will focus on a specific ensemble technique that efficiently implement bagging by using decision trees: the random forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond improved prediction, bagging algorithms provide an additional benefit. Since each tree (or other learning algorithm in the case of a _Bagging_ estimator) is constructed from a subsample of the original data, the performance of that tree can be tested on the data from the original data that were not used in its construction. These data are known as _out-of-bag_ data, and provide a useful metric for the performance of each individual tree used in the ensemble. \n",

    "\n",
    "Bootstrap is a general procedure that can be used to reduce the variance for those algorithms that have high variance like decision tree. When bagging with decision trees, we are less concerned about individual tree overfitting the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [random forest][wrf] employs bagging to create a set of decision trees from a given data set. Each tree is constructed from a bootstrap sample, and the final prediction is generated by aggregating the predictions of the individual trees, just like the previous code example demonstrated by using the mean of the sample means to estimate the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, when deciding on a split point during the construction of a decision tree, all features are evaluated and the one that has the highest impurity (or produces the largest information gain) is selected as the feature on which to split along with the value at which to split that feature. In a random forest, a random subset of all features are used to make the split choice, and the best feature on which to split is selected form this subset. \n",
    "\n",
    "This extra randomness produces individual decision trees that are less sensitive to small scale fluctuations, which is known as under-fitting. As a result, each newly created decision tree is a weak learner since they are not constructed from all available information. Yet, since each decision tree is constructed from different sets of features, by aggregating their predictions, the final random forest prediction is improved and less affected by overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tree in the random forest is constructed from a different combination of features. As a result, we can use the _out-of-bag_ performance from each tree to rank the importance of the features used to construct the trees in the forest. This allows for robust estimates of feature importance to be computed after constructing a random forest, which can provide useful insight into the nature of a training data set.\n",

    "- `max_features`, which is the number of features to examine when choosing the best split feature and value. By default this is `auto`, which means the square root of the total number of features. Other values can be an integer number of features, a floating point percentage of the total number of features (e.g., 25% of all features randomly selected), the square root of the total number of features, and the base two logarithm of the total number of features.\n",

    "We can now apply the Random Forest algorithm to the Adult Income data to create a classification model. The basic approach is simple, and follows the standard scikit-learn estimator philosophy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare data. We first load data, then create label from `Salary` column, then encode categorical features. Note that for tree-based ensemble classifier, we don't have to create dummy variables for categorical features, and we also don't need to scale or normalize training features. Finally, we will split the data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "2. Import our estimator, [`RandomForestClassifier`][skdtc], from the proper scikit-learn module, `ensemble`.\n",
    "3. Create the estimator and specify the appropriate hyperparameters. For a random forest, we can accept the defaults, or specify values for specific hyperparameters such as `n_estimators` or `max_features`.\n",
    "4. Fit the model to the training data.\n",
    "5. Predict new classes with our trained model (or in the simple demonstration below, generate a performance metric via the `score` method).\n",

    "In the first code cell, we load the data and create label from `Salary`. \n",
    "\n",

    "### Random Forest: Feature Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "As the previous example demonstrated, the random forest is easy to use and often provides impressive results. In addition, by its very nature, a random forest provides an implicit measure of the importance of the individual features in generating the final predictions. While an individual decision tree provides this information, the random forest provides an aggregated result, that is generally more insightful and less sensitive to fluctuations in the training data that might bias the importance values determined by a decision tree. In the calculation of feature importance from a random forest, higher values indicate a more important feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate how to extract the feature importance for a random forest classifier in the following Code cell. We zip the training data column names with the model's feature_importances_ attribute, then convert it to a dataframe so that we can sort by the importance and print it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the feature importance we can see that Sex and Race are not very important in determining income, comparing to Age and Education Level.\n",

    "A random forest can also be used to perform regression; however, in this case the goal is  to create tress whose leaf nodes contain data that are nearby in the overall feature space. To make a predict a continuous value from a tree we either have leaf nodes with only one feature, and use the relevant feature from that instance as our predictor, or we compute summary statistics from the instances in the appropriate leaf node, such as the mean or mode. In the end, the random forest aggregates the indivudla tree regreession predictions into a final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform regression with the scikit-learn library we employ the [`RandomForestRegressor`][skrfr] estimator in the tree module. One point, which was also true for classification, by specifying the `random_state` hyperparameter, we ensure reproducibility. This is because every time a tree is constructed, the features are randomly selected. Thus, even if we use the same set of hyperparameters and the same set of training data, we can end up with different trees, and thus a different forest, if the `random_state` hyperparameter is not fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we employ a random forest to perform regression on the automotive fuel performance prediction, these data were fully described in the _Introduction to Decision Trees_ notebook. First, we will introduce these data, and prepare them for the regression task. We will employ the patsy module to use a regression formula to create our dependent and independent feature matrices. Finally, we will construct a decision tree regressor on these data and evaluate its performance.\n",
