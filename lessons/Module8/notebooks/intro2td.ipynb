    "While it might seem that working with time in a program would be simple, the reality is that handling time data is complicated by several challenges. For a discussion of these issues, see the official Python [time documentation][td]. First, computers are designed to work with numerical data, so what is the numerical representation for a time? The simple solution for this problem is to define an epoch, or starting point for time data, which in Python (or Unix systems in general) is typically taken to be midnight, or 00:00:00, on January 1, 1970(UTC). \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, time is relative, and is measured relative to a time zone. For example, in Champaign-Urbana, we are in the US Central time zone. Programmatically, time zones are often indicated by the large major cities. Thus, for the University of Illinois we would programmatically refer to our time zone by 'America/Chicago'. The epoch is defined in the UTC(Coordinated Universal Time) time zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "These issues, and the way we deal with them in Python, are demonstrated in the following Code cells. First, we import the `time` module, and demonstrate how to convert between the time (in seconds) since the start of the current epoch and the corresponding time representation by using the `ctime` function. These times can, of course, extend into the future. We can perform the conversion in the other direction (time to seconds since the start of the epoch) by using the `time` function.\n",
