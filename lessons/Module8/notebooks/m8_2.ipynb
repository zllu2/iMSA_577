    "## Analyzing Time Series Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we focus on analyzing time series data by using Python and the Pandas library. First, we will look at how to use Pandas to handle time and date data. Next, we will look at performing simple time series operations such as grouping, merging, and filtering by using dates. Finally, we will see how to generate insightful visualizations of time series data.\n",
