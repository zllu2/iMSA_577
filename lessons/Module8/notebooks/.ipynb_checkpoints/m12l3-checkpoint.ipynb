    "\n",
    "In many practical settings, we observe the state of a system, such as a financial time series, that we assume is the combination of multiple effects. These effects can be modeled as states, which while hidden to us, produce outputs that are visible. The hidden Markov model extends the Markov process, described in an earlier lesson, to model these systems. \n",
