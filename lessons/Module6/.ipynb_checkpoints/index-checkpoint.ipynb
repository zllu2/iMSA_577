    "# Module 6: Introduction to Text Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, you will start applying your new machine learning skills to an exciting data analytic topic: Text Analysis. First, we will to review the process by which textual data is converted into numerical data that can be processed by a computer. Along with this are a number of new concepts that focus on manipulating these data to generate improved machine learning predictions. Second, we will apply machine learning algorithms specifically  classification to text data. Finally, we will explore the more advanced concepts in text analysis and introduce a special kind of text classification: setiment analysis.\n",
