    "# Module 6: Introduction to Text Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, you will start applying your new machine learning skills to an exciting data analytic topic: Text Analysis. First, we will review the process by which textual data is converted into numerical data that can be processed by a computer. Along with this are a number of new concepts that focus on manipulating these data to generate improved machine learning predictions. Second, we will apply machine learning algorithms, specifically  classification, to text data. Finally, we will explore the more advanced concepts in text analysis and introduce a special kind of text classification: setiment analysis.\n",
