    "# Module 8: Introduction to Network Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we introduce basic network analysis, which will involve the Python [NetworkX][nw] library. First, we will discuss how network, or graph, analysis can be used by businesses. Second, we introduce basic graph concepts such as a node, edge, and the difference between directed and undirected graphs. Next, we will discuss matrix representations of graph data, graph visualizations, and basic graph analysis including quantifying graph distances, diameters, and densities. After this, we will discus graph traversal and exploration. Finally, we will learn how to apply these concepts to analyze social media data.\n",
