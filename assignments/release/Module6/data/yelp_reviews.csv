5,"I love love LOVE this place. My boss (who is into healthy eating) recommended this place. I went over with some highly skeptical friends and one dinner was enough to convert them into believers! The food here is so good! We had the Shrimp dumplings and the Onion tart as starters. We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees. So also ordered the Kale-aid. All of the dishes were yummy. 
I have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed! I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid. 
Once, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date! Ever since, I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes! I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness! I don't think I can live without True Food!"
5,"The best !

From my first shredded beef taco almost a year ago  ..i have been lovin' this place.
I also love the number 13 combo platter (.Mini beef chimi's ,Gauc ,rice and beans) 

The tacos are 5 star fresh and yum ! ... AND reasonably priced."
5,"I love Coach.
Stylish and trendy without spending an obscene amount of money on a bag. Sure they are still a bit more pricey than a purse at Target, but you are paying for name. The sales associates are really nice and won't hesitate talking to you. I only have a few things from Coach because usually I can't justify spending to much money to accessories, but anything you buy here you can use forever. A coach bag will probably never go out of style."
5,This place is great!
5,"I have been going to the Matador since I was little when it was a little hole in the wall on 2nd Street.  They have always had great Sonoran style Mexican food!  It's always our go to place when we attend events downtown or have business to attend to. They also have the best hot sauce in town!  As far as the service,  the food comes out quickly and we never really have to wait long.  If you're downtown and looking for great food I would highly recommend this place."
5,"I don't actually hunt or fish, but after visiting this place, I'd like to take up those activities. This place is like a giant outdoors amusement park. Everything you could possibly want for outdoor activities is included in this store. I could spend hours in this store just looking at everything they have available. Plus, now I know where to buy the furniture if I ever get a hunting lodge."
5,Best BBQ ever.  Go here and thank me later.
5,"As far as gourmet burger joints go, this place is the bomb! I am a huge fan of Deluxe Burger and now they have a run for their money! Plus the parking is much easier at Zinburger. I had the Zinburger, and we shared sweet potato fries and regular fries. Everything was delicious! All 3 of had the Zinburger, so not much variety at our table, but we all finished our burgers, and given the size of them, I was pretty surprised/impressed with all of us. The burger was heavenly, juicy and cooked perfectly. I would definitely go back, again and again!"
5,"Juan Jaime's is where the simple taste of Mexico are served with delectable results.  The kitchen produces vibrant fiesta flavors that left me wanting more. The simple menu offers approachable, exciting, delicious food that satisfies any appetite.  The Margarita's flavor should be praised. And the staff is top notch.  This is just what Chandler needed.  If you go ask for the Grilled Mahi Mahi.  You'll thank me later.  I can't wait to go back."
5,"I'm sure most people don't go to a fancy steak restaurant for the Mac 'n cheese, but as a mac aficionado, it's practically my duty. And the mac here, well it's high quality. I like to order the lobster mac sans lobster (not a big fan of seafood), which without the seafood, is actually quite inexpensive. Now be warned, this is real heavy mac 'n cheese. It's so cheesy, and thick, and delicious; don't plan on being able to wiggle out of your booth any time soon after eating it."
5,I was referred to Jones Family Dentistry for an emergency procedure. I cannot express how incredible the staff and doctors were. I appreciate all the time and help they gave me. The follow up phone call really showed how caring they are. AMAZING Dentists!!! My family has a new dentist. Thank you!!!
5,Amanda was very helpful when we looking at the ferrits.....   A great pet store.
5,"From the moment I walked into the lobby the staff displayed a level of professionalism that you don't get to see everyday. Each staff member that I came into contact with gave me a handshake and said, ""Welcome to our business"". I don't normally enjoy going to the dentist, but this has been the complete opposite. They made me feel very comfortable and confident that I was going to be happy with my experience, and I was!  So I set up an appointment for my 9 year old son on the way out. Since then we have both been in to have work done. My son need one filling and he took it very well, then trotted off to school like nothing ever happened. I started with a deep cleaning from Bobbie Lynn Tucker , RDH.  She was very nice and personable, did a wonderful job cleaning my teeth, not to mention gentle. I was never in any pain either during or after the procedure.  My following visit was with Dr. Brittian, DDS.  I needed a few fillings and I am very pleased with his work. Again gentle and quick.  My teeth look beautiful and feel wonderful. They were great with explaining all the costs and have cool perks like a Rewards Program.  I also liked the glass back wall that gives the patient a private calm view of the outdoors. The flat screens are cool too, but my only complaint is that when I asked quite seriously if they could change the channel, ( I dislike sport shows a lot) they were not going to budge. That might be something they want to work out. Other than that I really would recommend  them to everyone."
5,"This was such a good experience
I was up all night with a extremely severe painful tooth ache
I don't have health insurance so I didn't think I could afford a dentist
Friends and Family told me to look up a dental school and thats how I found A.T. Still
I called and they said they accept five Emergency patients a day at 1:pm
It was 11am but I didn't care I drove straight there and I was the first patient seen at 1p.m.
it cost $15 to be seen, $15 for the X-Rays, and turns out my wisdom tooth was infected and had a cavity

so they sent me up to oral surgery, it cost me $85 to get the tooth extracted
i was nervous and they talked me through it and calmed my fears
It didn't hurt at all, I was numbed up and the student did a good job

they gave me a three prescriptions to take with me and I have to return next week for follow - up
the follow up appointment is FREE!

totally recommend this place to any and everyone!"
5,"They have the nicest staff and the Dr. is always open when examining our dog! We have boarded her there as well and the staff is so kind, and when our dog gets there she cant wait to run up and play with the staff!"
5,"One of my favorites. The crispy chicken tacos are overstuffed with meat,lettuce,cheese and always filling. The prices are reasonable for what you get. Also like Julios g  too next door for quick take out  or ""no Tip"" casual meal. Self serve chips and mild chunky salsa  are terrific."
5,"Awesome, Big Ben sandwich is delish and chocolate/strawberry scones is one of the best I have ever had, and can't forget to mention the coffee and tea, great place"
5,"I'm very new to PHX. I ended up talking to a cop at the airport who told me about Thursday Rockabilly nights at the Blooze. I had to check it out. My friend and I walked in and were instantly comfortable, excited, and impressed. The AC was pumping, beer was cold, the music; rockin, and the crowd; refreshing. The bathroom was great! 
They don't have food there but they will let you bring in whatever you want. We went there pretty early, around 7:30ish. Unfortunately, because of ridiculously early work on Fri AM, I had to leave once it was starting to get really packed and lively around 10:30/11. I am so glad that I finally checked the place out though. I will definitely frequent The Blooze as often as I can."
5,"I live within walking distance of the Japanese Friendship Garden, so I enjoy it frequently.  Once inside, it's hard to believe you're still in Phoenix.  That's why I was so happy when Groupon recently offered a half-price membership.  I would join in a minute, except they're closed from May to October or so.  Half-price membership seems about right.

The atmosphere is gentle and meditative.  I feel safe sitting on a bench and actually meditating here.  The koi kind of freak me out.  They've been fed so often  by visitors that I feel fairly certain they'd eat me if I fell into the pond.  Last time I visited, there were baby ducks in the house.  So cute and fluffy, and they had no fear of people."
5,"It is a 110 mile round trip for me, passing who knows how many salons along the way, and it is well worth the drive even during rush hour. Ask for Ray if you want an amazing hair experience. You will go home feeling beautiful/handsome."
5,John did a fantastic job on figuring out my overheating issue on my Infiniti after Grelichs failed to fix my car properly. John is more than fair with there pricing and are extremely knowledgeable. He has a customer for life from me.
5,"Ahhh Shady's...I am a little embarrassed to admit how often I frequent this gem of a place, but definitely not ashamed of how much I love it.  Cool atmosphere, just the right lighting (very important to me), great bartenders, good prices on a really nice selection (Who else has Old Raj gin or Agwa De Bolivia?).   This is definitely not a dive bar (not that there's anything wrong with that), but it's not an icey, blase Snobbsdale-ish joint either, and I've never felt ridiculed or snubbed here either by patron or bartender.  I've seen all walks of life come through this place, but never felt that it was too 'hip' or pretentious in any way. Great jukebox, obscure, forgotten movies playing on the telly, bartenders that are nice to look at (male and female), have personality and actually remember your name (and drink).  Does it get any better than this?"
5,"My husband and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Every time we drive by he wants to go in and eat. Even if we are driving home from a dinner we just had!! 

1. The people that work there are AMAZING. They are so nice and hospitable, always glad to see you and let you decide the type of dining experience you want. (romantic date, take out, quick bar eats, etc.) 

2. This is the freshest place for seafood I have found in Phoenix. I don't know how they find half of the stuff the serve, but they do, and it is just off the boat. (I lived in Boston for 3 years and they get stuff I crave, like Kumomato Oysters, all types of fish and meat from East Coast farms) 

3. Pricing is right on...since they are serving stuff that is difficult to procure, I am always amazed at the value they present. 


Keep Rocking Yasu!!!"
5,Great food and service! Country food at its best!
5,"Amazing.

Fogo de chao is nothing short of out of this world. It is expensive, but as soon as you start, you'll know exactly where that money went.
Seriously. Try it."
5,"This is by far the best farmer's market I've been to in the Valley.  Still small by comparison to LA and the Bay Area but is off to a great start with lots of potential and space to grow into.

McClendon has a great spread of high quality mainly organic produce and is constantly restocking so it's ok if you don't get there first thing.  It was exciting to see beautiful Tuscan kale and broccoli rabe at prices lower than Sprouts.  Meyer lemons and blood oranges were also available.

Phoenician's outstanding loaves were only $3. You're welcome to sample - we particularly liked the Olive Walnut and Dark Chocolate Cherry.

We enjoyed Digestif's Frittata ($4) made with thin layers of potato, eggs, pork belly and spinach.  Other combinations available were Dandelion with Goat Cheese and Mushrooms with Garlic Confit. Executive Chef Payton Curry is also there to demonstrate pulling fresh mozzarella which is served with a variety of sauces and toppings,

It was fun walking around this bustling market sampling food, like tamales, which we intend to come back for next week.  If I can get myself out of bed at a decent hour on Sat, I'll be here for sure every week until the season ends in May."
5,"This is one of the top three Dog Parks in the Valley. Plenty of room, well lit in the evenings, plenty of water. I've seen the attendance shift slightly in the last year with less hipsters and more kooks coming in. Not a problem though because there are always multiple groups to mingle with.
For photos and a complete review of this park go to www.dogparkriot.com."
5,"So, for my date tonight to the Compass Room, I needed to get my nails done.  I removed my acrylics myself last week.  
I read the reviews here and decided to try DV.
You know, sometimes when you walk into a nail shop for the first time, it's almost like the Soup Nazi.  Not this place!
There were two girls ahead of me, so I waited a bit, but only about ten minutes.  
It's bigger than the place I had been going to!  Really clean and I heard ENGLISH being spoken by the nail techs!  That was nice.  Yeah, there were still speaking Vietnamese (or so I think) to each other, yes, probably about us gringas, but it was refreshing to hear actualy conversations.
I had Le.  She was so sweet!  I told her all about my date, too.
She was quick, and made some suggestions about what to get.  Usually I like clear tips that they have to paint.  I was kinda short on time, so I went with her suggestion of white tips.  Plus, it was about $5 cheaper.
She was quick but *really* methodical.  
I think this may be the nicest set of acrylics I've gotten out here in the PHX!
She even called me by name throughout the conversation.
$25 for a new full set.  Not bad at all"
5,Very consistent food. Definitely a second best to P.F. Chang's.
5,"I absolutely love this place!  I've had my birthday here twice in the last 5 years, and they have been able to accommodate large groups (up to 20s).  Their patio is super cute and great in the fall and spring time.  My favorite pizza is the Di Notte.  Cute atmosphere combined with good food = one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  Worth the drive to downtown!"
5,"This is by far the best Chicken Fried Steak around!  Not to mention their mashed potatoe's, salad and biscuit!  I've never been able to clean my plate here, which is great since I always have an extra meal!   Of course you can always get the lunch portion which is smaller, but then you don't have the extra goodies for later!  

It's a small down home place, dress comfy and go there to eat up!  The wait staff is always the best and they know their stuff!  

I've had their T-Bone here, and it's good, but really hard to go there and not get what made them famous!  Wonderful food!

Prices for lunch are around $7.00 and dinner around $12.00 - really hard to beat for real down home cooking!"
5,"part of a social event, we only had app's here. quite delicious crab cakes and a shrimp fritters with mango sauce. the portions were gigantic and actually big enough for a meal. i was slightly full afterwards. part of the roaring fork, wildfish franchise, they also offer a great happy hour. seems a bit high priced but our bill was taken care of, so i'd save this (for the middle class foodie) for a special event."
5,"Great food, great Sangria, great live music, great vibe, great service EXCLAMATION MARK. Overall it was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon."
5,"I'm giving this Office Max five stars for convenience, friendly service, competitively priced products a stocked shelves. 

This Office Max is a great in and out shop. On one side there is the detailed supply store and on the office side, there is a complete copy center. It's open until 9 on the weekdays and they don't make you feel rushed if you get there at oh let's say...8:50. In fact, they are helpful! They walked me around and helped me find the random items I needed. The copy center staff was also very friendly. 

This Office Max has your complete supply of office items but their prices are very reasonable! I purchased the same item at another shop that I did here and it was significantly less expensive here. 

So on that note, I end my review on Office Max but I will report back with any new findings."
5,"Went here earlier this spring and WOW - What a way to watch spring training 
I LOVE the Giants stadium, and this is much better. It has twice as much lawn seating, the seats are wide and comfortable AND - aimed towards home plate, which didn't used to seem like a big deal but sitting in Scottsdale down the line, IT IS. 
The food there is top notch, with an amazing pizza slice 
Plus, the ability to walk around to diff fields and watch other players work out is amazing - it sucks that the Giants keep fields separate, I think every team should do such a joint complex."
5,"Do you hate shaving as much as I do? Do you find waxing too painful and expensive every 6-8 weeks?  Well I have the answer for you!!!  Go see Cindy Semerdjian at Cosmetic Laser Solutions.  I was introduced to Cindy through a friend AND NOW I AM HOOKED!!!   Not only do I no longer have hair, it is very inexpensive!  How much did it cost for you to get waxed...what would you say if I told you for a few dollars more the hair would be gone...PERMANENTLY!   

Cindy offers a free initial consultation.  A few prices that I have experienced on a per session basis is: underarm - $100 ; bikini (brazilian) - $100; full leg (both) - $250.

I highly, highly recommend going to see Cindy!  Tell her Jillian sent you!    

So get started today to get ready for summer!"
5,"Hertz Gold Club service worked perfectly for me. My Toyota Corolla, booked over the internet, was in its bay and ready to go.

The buses to and from the rental centre were frequent and painless to use."
5,"Celebrated my anniversary here. Everything was amazing. Enjoyed the filet mignon and the lobster with prawns. Luis was our server and made our experience truly amazing. He made everything perfect. He gave us our space, but at the same time entertained us when appropriate. He recommended a great wine to pair with the lobster, and made sure we were well taken care. We capped our meal off with creme brulee and a dessert wine. We will definitely come back here and ask for Luis again."
5,"This is the most comfortable place to have a glass of wine, relax, and enjoy some great food. Their service is amazing. There are really comfy seats and couches inside and great outdoor seating. You could literally spend hours here. They have wi-fi, so you can chill out on your CPU or IPad. The bar super cool. Very nice bartenders that are knowledgable and accommodating. Their wine is killer, of course, or they wouldn't be named 5th and Wine right?"
5,"I love this place. Food is ALWAYS fresh, cook correct and service is great. Not to mention their lunch specials!!! My husband and I always spend less than 20 bucks and get full and satisfied EVERYTIME!!!!"
5,"As a sissy vegetarian, I feel compelled to mention the soup that no one has yet mentioned at Da Vang - THE TAMARIND BASED SOUP HOT POT IS AMAZING!

I don't know if they use any other animal broth in it, because I am willfully ignorant of such matters.  Regardless, if you are a meat eater or a vegetarian, try the tamarind soup, and bring friends.  It is super yummy.

They also have a rice-based soup.  And, if you talk to your server, they can likely recommend some vegetarian/tofu based dishes that will be wonderful.

Everything else is as good as everyone says it is.  Wouldn't be surprised if people got an occasional bowl of sub-par pho; every family restaurant makes mistakes.  I'd recommend everyone try it again."
5,"We live in Chandler, so we get take out here probably once a month. My husband is from the east coast and in both his and my opinion, these are the best cheesesteaks around! We love their spicy peppers (they are hot!) and while I am not really a cheesesteak fan, their chicken cheesesteak sandwiches are fabulous! The owners are hard working and really appreciate all of their customers and let you know it! 

We have been eating here for three years now and have never had a bad experience."
5,"This is my kind of restaurant. I love everything about Buca di Beppo!

I am fascinated by how this place was decorated. All the walls and various trinkets make this a fun dining experience. 

One thing to note is that it can be kind of expensive to eat here, although I am always finding coupons for this restaurant so that helps!

Beyond that the food is awesome! I go with my fiance and we love the calamari and the garlic bread, which we always get as appetizers. We switch up the main course when we go, but each time has had great results. We had dessert here once too and that was also good! We usually end up with leftovers, because they give huge portions, which we love. I can't wait to come again!"
5,"Even though I've rarely had anything else on their menu except for hummus, I highly recommend this little greek hot spot. They have tons of regulars because the food keeps them coming back. The hummus is to die for (it only comes with one pita however, so I always order 2-3 extra). I have also tried their veggie gyro which is great. I have brought many meat-loving friends here and I've never heard anything but great things about their experience with their food. 

The staff is completely Greek. They are friendly in their own unique kind of way. Because I usually saunter in with a drink from Starbucks (same parking lot), the female owner assumes I work there and she always asks me how business is going at SB. I corrected her the first few times, but she continued to ask, so now I just keep it going and tell her it's going great but that I hate my job (because I'm assuming I would, if I worked there). I love her personality...very intense. Never smiles, even when a smile would be just right. But she is still very kind. Always look forward to seeing her and eating her food."
5,"I dined in Sol this past week and was amazed. I am in the industry and have absolutely fell in love with this place. The food is not only original but good an healthy. I will say this though if you are looking for refried beans and mush on your plate this is not the mexican food for you. It reminded me of time i have spent down the coast of mexico, very wonderful. I can see them still working out a few errors but they are very quick to fix any mistake. the service i had was absolutely amazing, it was nice to see someone like the tall good looking gentlemen i had wait on me. he was funny and kept my table laughing and very informative overall, i really had a sense during my meal he wanted nothing but the best for my table. definitely somewhere i will be back too for sure, especially since im craving that taco vampiro again."
5,"Recently I had the pleasure of eating at this great new Iron Chef Jose Garces restaurant. Pulling up to the front entrance to the restaurant my girlfriend and I were greeted by extremely nice doorman who valet our vehicle for us. We were a bit concerned that we were going to get wet from the rain on this day, but thanks to the valet service the hotel & restaurant provide we stayed warm and dry! Now I must say we were taken back from the decor inside the restaurant... It was spectacular!! The way the restaurant is decorated just puts a smile on your face! Also, it gives you a feel for Iron Chef Jose Garces personality which seems to be light and fun. The food is absolutely amazing!! We split the ""IGNACIO"" Nachos which have black beans, tomato, queso mixto, jalapeño, chile de arbol, and radish, and the Barbbacoa ""Costillas"" berkshire pork spare ribs, chipotle-cider mustard bbq they were tender, juicy, and delicious! We tried the House Margarita the ""Distrito"" and the white ""Mexican Sangria"" both were spectacular!! I have never heard of a white sangria before.. But WOW it was amazing! All of the employees we encountered were extremely nice, knowledgeable, and sincere. This restaurant will definitely stay on my regular to do list! Thanks to everyone who gave us a wonderful experience!!!"
5,"Always consistent. Great service, great carne asada and a pleasant patio on a beautiful day."
5,"I dream about their chopped salad...I, too, would use it as my screen saver if I didn't share a computer."
5,"I can't describe to you how amazing these gourmet adult hot pockets taste! They literally MELT in your mouth- a few of my favorites are the Cajun Chicken, Dill Salmon, and the Stilton & Steak---Bon Appetit everyone! And don't forget about the all day everyday-$3 car bombs(you can't beat that price) their happy hour is amazing, too!"
5,"NOCA...  wow.

Have you seen the outer limits show where the chef owns a device that when placed in a small room with a single person drives the person completely insane with fear but creates a liquid extract that adds complete and utter bliss to food.  That liquid is then added to  the restaurant's soup which is revered as the best soup in the word.  Limit 1 bowl per person...?

NOCA must have gotten their hands on this relic.  Honestly.  This has probably been the best dining experience of my life.   Everything was delicious on its own, all together, or when combining just a few of the items on the plate.  

Walked in and our server seated us.  They brought us an amuse-bouche that had a small amount of blue cheese, chorizo, and chives.  Was delicious.  Then bread was served. After that, our Bacon and Egg was served.  This was phenomenal.  A crispy perfectly poached egg with oh so tender pork belly....mmmm

My fiance ordered the butternut squash cannelloni and I ordered the duck.  Both were amazing.  The duck was so moist and tender but not greasy at all.  We then were served cotton candy as we waiting on our 2 desserts to arrive.  We had the donuts and the de-constructed cheesecake.  I had an espresso and my fiance had the vanilla malted milk shake.

All of this was amazing.  My fiance wasn't in the mood for wine, so I delved into the beer list and low and behold, 90 minute IPA from dogfish head.... NOCA, I love you."
5,"I can only vouch for the chicken salad, as it's the only thing I've ever tried in the 20 years I've been coming here. It's THAT good. I always think about trying something else, but why mess with perfection?

Walking inside gives you the sense that you've stepped into a time machine and arrived in the late 70's. I, personally, find it to be awesome. Most of Scottsdale is lacking in historic flare. And yes, the late 70s is historic by Scottsdale standards. Besides, whatever money they're not spending on updating the decor is clearly going right into their magically delicious chicken salad."
5,"i absolutely LOVE maxim and i have eaten there approximately 2 times a week since i learned about the restaurant a year ago.  the atmosphere is pretty awful, but the food is amazing.  i get a #86, which is a noodle, tofu, and vegetable soup (the broth is meat based).  it is comforting and cheap and always improves a bad day.  everyone i have taken there has enjoyed the food as well (though they tend to enjoy the vietnamese dishes more than the chinese ones). highly, highly recommended."
5,"I just love Chipotle. Fresh, yummy, spicy (if you want it to be). And the restaurant was clean a HUGE plus! My personal fav is the chicken burrito, no rice, no beans w/ fajita veggies, pico, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce. Guacamole and hot sauce on the side. So delicious!!! The person who did our order was so nice! It was my friend's first Chipotle experience! She was impressed by how big the burrito was. I'm glad I only live a few blocks away... because I will be back."
5,"So, I now frequent The Vig.  If you go, talk to Jason, the bartender.  He's quick with the beverages and funny.  Enjoy yourself.  You deserve it!  This place can get packed during dinner hour, though."
5,Carlsbad Tavern is my favorite Mexican restaurant. I love the dark and cozy atmosphere inside and I love that they have Hoegaarden on tap.. I've had the machaca burrito and fish tacos here and both dishes were amazing. They serve New Mexico cuisine here. The only difference I noticed is they are big on green chile and use black beans instead of refried beans. I have a lot of friends from New Mexico and they all love this restaurant. The food here is delicious and flavorful if you don't live in the neighborhood it's definitely worth the drive.
5,"I found this little hot spot on Yelp and used my phone to navigate me there; I wouldn't have found it otherwise.  This small establishment is hidden in a neighborhood right off of Historic Downtown Chandler.  It's a quaint little diner with modest décor.  I felt very comfortable there and the service was fast and friendly.  As I looked over the menu the first thing I saw was the Morning Monte and havarti cheese as one of the ingredients.  Cheddar isn't better; it's all about havarti folks!  I needn't look further; I knew that's what I was having.  Hawaiian bread French toast, bacon, turkey, egg and the havarti - absolutely delicious!  Can't wait to come back and bring everyone I know."
5,Fast service. Great burgers and fries. So far the Arizona burger coupled with sweet potato fries is my favorite.
5,"I brought in six pairs of shoes to Ariel to see if he could put new heels on them (I wear the spiky-heeled high heels).  For $12, not only did Ariel put new heels that perfectly matched each color, size and type of heel (and even filed them just a hair so that they would wear smoothly), but he also put a lot of work into fixing the front of them.  Many of my shoes had toes that were worn, shredded or faded; Ariel made them like absolutely new.  Amazing!

My shoes are not Prada or Gucci.  They are mostly Nine West with leather uppers and man-made everything else.  :)  However, Ariel took amazing care of them as if they were ""the king's"" shoes.  It is so great to have my favorite pairs of shoes back.  I will return.  Thank you, Ariel!"
5,"Monkey Pants has some of the best burgers in AZ.  Great place for a long lazy lunch over some pitchers.  I think one month my friends and I went there like 20 times for lunch.  Never got sick of it.  It's a dive bar, but it's a cool dive bar."
5,"Finally, a great place to get breakfast that isn't Denny's or iHop in Gilbert. Came here with my family and we just made it before the change in menus. 

The griddle bread pudding was AMAZING! Probably the highlight of the meal. We also ordered the veggie sandwich, All-American breakfast (?), a slice of red velvet cake.  

We have definitely found our go-to Breakfast joint when my sister and I, both come back to Gilbert to visit the 'Rents."
5,"Dr. Jason Kanarish is absolutely amazing.  I am a Physician Assistant in surgery, and  appreciated his ""bedside"" manner as well as medical knowledge, which was phenomenal.  He spent AMPLE TIME with me and answered EVERY QUESTION I had.  Not to mention, he was fantastic with my scared min pin. I cannot recommend him enough.  The staff is also extremely friendly and helpful!"
5,"Amazing. Just stopped for snacks, had the fake crab rangoons and samosas. Very good. Will mos def come back to dine, hopefully several times, when in town. 

Love that they sell Diaya in the cooler and other lovely products, books and junk foods!"
5,"What can I say about Execucar. I love their service. It cost just as much if not cheaper than taking a cab for me. I make a reservation on-line, get confirmation via email as well as a phone call the day before confirming my reservation. The cars are always nice, clean, and fresh smelling (yes that may seem weird but I have been in some cabs that were like WHOA!) The drivers are always in shirts, ties, and slacks and they are professional and courteous. I have never had a driver be late (knock on wood) and they have always gotten me to the airport on-time. Plus I get some frequent flyer miles added to my USAirways account for using them. Can we say bonus!"
5,"This place seems to get better every time I visit. The first time was a Friday night out with the guys. We met up for dinner and I had (and loved) the pulled pork and sweet potato fries. After dinne we got our drink on with a live band. The waitress was helpful in getting us drunk off a variety of liquors. And the shots kept on coming! It was a blast. The second time was more laid back, just grabbing a beer with a girlfriend. It was a Tuesday and the place was pretty busy. The next time me and the girlfriend showed up completely wasted and they had an Irish band playing. It was a perfect way to end our night after clubbing at the gay bar! We had a baileys nightcap and everything went dark from there. Awesome night!"
5,"Jodi is fantastic!  Extraordinary!  After too many expensive yet less-than-average salon expereinces, my hair has been less beautiful than its potential.  Jodi gave me a very thorough consultation after I did some research to find the best colorist for me.  During my appointment, Jodi was professional, efficient and friendly.  I left the salon with soft, gorgeous hair... lovely color, care of the INOA line, and I felt beautiful again.  She did what at least half a dozen other highly recommended colorists did not accomplish.  I'm ecstatic and relieved and I have finally found my colorist.  What more can a girl ask?  Thanks so much, Jodi."
5,"The new Kale salad is to die for! 
I love this place! Every time we have lunch here it is busy but somehow the staff always finds us a seat! The food is always really good and the speed in which you get it is amazing. This is the best lunch place in the valley!"
5,I love supporting local coffee houses and this one is my favorite.  They are always super friendly even if I sit in there for hours studying and only order one drink.  I LOVE their sugar free avalanches!
5,Mastro's serves up the best steak in Scottsdale.  They also offer delicious seafood and excellent side dishes.  Prices are steep. After 10pm this place becomes a pick up joint for gold digging women seeking sugar daddy's.
5,"What a great way to spend Easter morning!

After taking part in the egg hunt on the main grounds (and BTW, they know how to do it here: Massive dumps of eggs full of goodies. More than the kids could carry. Plenty of photo ops. Parents who weren't acting out scenes from Soylent Green.) we made our way to this nicely upscale coffee shop/casual dining spot. 

We were seated 30 minutes ahead of our reservation, keeping my little guy from popping a gasket. I chose the $19 breakfast buffet, and considering it included a custom-made omelette with organic ingredients--as well as juice and coffee--it was a steal. 

Service was wonderful and the staff was sure to make us feel at home. Well, actually better than home because I don't have people looking after my every whim and need while at home."
5,"we rode our bikes here today in search of a new place to try. the online menu looked like it had a few options for non-meat eaters (although it is very much a meat heavy menu). 

for an easter sunday lunch, it was very empty, not a good sign. but we had no wait and they easily passed the water glass test. our server was very attentive and checked on us throughout the meal without being overbearing. 

the decor is ""country"" but not like cracker barrel....more like neo farm dining. 

i had the blackened fish sandwich, which was cooked really well, nice and seared but juicy, topped with onion, pickles, tomatoes and butter lettuce. i had the jalpeno and cheese grits on the side and they were rich and creamy with just a slight hint of heat...nothing to burn your mouth. 
my wife had the tuna sandwich, which was also tasty and seared just right. she did have to navigate a big piece of fascia which is not that delectable, but it was her dish, not mine. her side of gigantic asparagus tasted wonderful. 

i would love to come back here and hope they are able to make it here. well worth the bike ride."
5,Cant say enough good things about Sens. Excellent food and excellent service.
5,"Stay in the courtyard recently and have no complaints at all!! RIght when I entered the place , the staff greeted us and they were all very nice and helpful with everything. Although i only stayed there for 1 night , i thought the rooms were very well kept and the bed was amazing! The first thing i do when i check into the room is look at the bed and sample how if feels and this bed was amazing! The rooms are about normal size and has a tv , desk , chair , etc..... Wifi is also a must whenever i travel and no complaints here. Wifi was fast and easily available. Did not have a chance to see the gym or the pool but they do have one. Overall , i would stay here again if i come by Phoenix!!"
5,This is one of my favorite places to go in Phoenix!! I love the $5 wine glasses during happy hour!! The bruschetta is out of this world!! The sundae with salted caramel and pretzels is probably one of the BEST things I have ever eaten!! :o)
5,"Hands down the best Vietnamese food we've found in metro Phoenix.  Enormous bowls of delicious pho, served quickly with friendly and efficient service.  Our ""go to"" place for pho now.  Cheap too!"
5,"I was there just last night, and today received a ROTD for my original review. Too weird.

Updates - They mix a great margarita! No fluorescent green pre mixed Margarita mix - they make it themselves with fresh lime juice. Yum.

The wine list is small but good. My current fave is the Argentinian Malbec.  It's only $6 a glass, and they pour generously. Very tasty wine.

The seating is not comfy if you like to slouch. If you sit up straight, it's fine. But seriously.... good posture is over rated.

It gets a little cold in there once in a while during the winter. Wear long sleeves. :) After 3 glasses of the Malbec last night, I didn't care.

This place has really been growing on me... nice to have such a great neighborhood watering hole!"
5,"Fantastic.  Absolutely fantastic.  I recommend OHSO for anyone looking to dine at a neighborhood bar and grill. 

I was really shocked when I dined at OHSO for a Sunday brunch.  I figured the variety of beers would be the focal point of the brewery; boy, was I wrong.  This place has some of the best dishes in Scottsdale supported by a huge selection of beer.  

Let me say this with more clarity: great food differentiates this place, not the huge variety of beers.  This is a great achievement considering many breweries focus on providing rare beers with mediocre food.  

The ""Burger + Cheese"" is simply awesome.  
A GREAT brunch dish is the ""Breakfast Burrito"" as well as the ""Breakfast Flatbread."""
5,"I've been to a ton of Pho places here in the valley, and this is the best one I've been to, by far.  The prices are reasonable and the Pho was fantastic.  The rolls were pretty good, but not the best I've had around here (that honor belongs to Saigon Pho, not too far from this place.  BBQ beef rolls there are fantastic, but I digress).  I haven't tried anything else at Pho Van, but it all looked pretty good too.  

The place is super clean and the service was ridiculously fast (I don't know if it was just my luck or if that's a regular thing).

I want to come back, but it's not close to my house.  However, it's worth the drive if you ever get that Pho craving."
5,"I'm a huge fan of Padre's! What food I've tried (I mainly just order tacos or their pork sliders usually) is delicious, the bartenders are awesome, and the owners are always friendly!

One of my favorite things to do: Order two tacos and half a bowl of guacamole with chips and salsa."
5,"I will continue to give this place five stars for so many reasons.  First, the menu is very creative, and offers a great variety of healthy food, with an Asian twist.  This time I had the shrimp curry, which had lots of fresh vegetables, and instead of a heavy cream curry, it was a much healthier broth curry.  We had the edamame dumplings again, which were as good as I remembered.  It was kind of cool to see Dr. Weil eating there last night.  It's good to know that he likes the place enough to dine there."
5,"I have to give them a 5 for their Guacamole and chips.
I am just in love with it.

Everytime I go to the US, I have to go there.
Cheap, super tasty and I love the salad bowl option they have (as I cannot eat wheat flour).
The meat is always tasty and fresh and again .....their guacamole ....the best !!!!

Always clean and fresh with friendly staff.

Healthy fast food .....

Just wish that we had it in Canada !!"
5,"Downright awesome and extremely hip. A non-traditional, very out there, but very hidden coffee joint.

You can't see this place from the street. It's kind of behind the Buffalo Exchange. It's almost the last place you would expect to find a coffee shop. As soon as you walk in there are really bright and vivid paintings, this is kind of what makes it way out there. Barista was very friendly and asked us how the weather was, always cool to have some small talk instead of the drone, ""what can i get for you..."" Wait, that basically sounds like the boring coffee-grinders at Starbucks.

I gotta have my lattes. I will drink regular coffee sometimes, but my soft spot is a well made latte. Amazing enough, places like Starbucks just don't know how to make lattes, I give up on Starbucks. Their beans suck, and apparently their frothing machines do too, because everytime I go there it seems like they just warm my milk and mix it with some coffee. The latte here was PERFECT. The milk was perfectly frothy, which in my opinion is what makes a latte a latte. Coffee had a nice roasted flavor to it. Amazingly, there are tons of coffee shops out there that can't do decent lattes. This is my new coffee place.

Good music choice here, its like new age elevator music, calm soothing hip hop and pop. Awesome atmosphere, quiet enough to study and have a conversation, yet lively enough to come for just a cup of caffeine. Skip the Starbucks and ""Sex in the City"" sorority girl drinks and come here.

Only problem was that I think they only have small or large lattes, and it was like $4 for a large. That's like $0.50 to a $1 too much in my honest opinion. Oh well, I think I'd still pay that when I'm craving a latte."
5,"I was given a $100 gift card to use at Willow Stream Spa last December... I've been waiting for the perfect day to use it since then.  Well, guess what? Today was that day!

With my fiance out of town for the weekend, I took advantage of some much deserved ""Gabi time"" as I like to call my downtime.  I called a few days ago to make an appointment and I asked if there were any specials going on.  Lucky for me, there were several!  The one that was most appealing to me was the ""book any 60 or 90 minute treatment and get a complimentary 30 minute treatment to go with it.""  I chose to book a 60 minute aromatherapy facial and a 30 minute complimentary massage to go with it... I was in heaven!

I'll back up a moment and just say that I've been to the Willow Stream Spa before... years ago.  Today was even more heavenly than I remembered.  I checked in around noon and didn't leave until after 6pm.  I could've stayed longer, but I had to come home to take Minnie out!

The Willow Stream facility is gorgeous and includes every amenity you can imagine... I started out in the fitness room for a quick workout and then took a glorious shower before my massage and facial.  I had Tomi for my massage and she focused on my neck, back, and shoulders... (I've been having shoulder pain so I think she customized this based on my situation).  She was fantastic but with just 30 minutes, it felt like a tease... my facial made it all worthwhile though- it was pure bliss!  Heather was my esthetician and did a fabulous job.  I highly recommend her - she explained every product she was using as I fell in and out of a relaxing sleep while she not only worked on my face but my shoulders, chest, neck, scalp, hands and feet... the products felt amazing and smelled good too.  So much so that I bought a couple on my way out.  

After my services, I had lunch (a delicious salad with veggies and chicken) while I wrote some thank you notes and read my book... It was so peaceful.  It was like an escape from the world and I enjoyed every second of it!

So, bottom line - if you are thinking about getting a spa-lover like me a gift anytime soon, Willow Stream Spa giftcards are always welcome... what an experience!  I'm feeling energized, relaxed, and peaceful."
5,I think this is the best fast mexican food in Chandler or the surrounding area.  The food quality is high and consistant.  The prices are downright CHEAP.  I really like the bean and cheese burritos and the chili relleno burritos.  The jalapenos and carrots are a must and I am thrilled that they started selling Tamarindo.
5,"i love this place. very rarely do i get to go out and tie one on. when i do, this is were i want to be at some point in the night. where else can i go and request the cramps? i...love...this...place, it makes me happy. i suppose i should go on and on about what it's like, but i won't. go and experience it for yourself."
5,"This place is awesome. 

A cornish pasty is like a big calzone stuffed with whatever you choose. They have many choices and all regular choices are also available as vegetarian entrees. These are HUGE so come hungry! Their tomato soup is also good but I would definitely stick to a pasty if you want a delicious meal.

The place is pretty divey but in a really great way. I have also heard they are expanding so those of you who have complained about their cramped quarters may find some reprieve soon. Personally, I like the small dark divey feel.

They also serve Rogue beer which is delicious if you haven't tried it. 

I like this place so much I eat there whenever I am in the area, which has prevented me from trying many other places nearby but I cant seem to bring myself not to go to Cornish as it is so good every time.

Highly recommend it if you are in the area."
5,"I love happy hour!  3PM to 6PM EVERYDAY! This place has one of, if not, THE BEST!!! $4 Grilled Chicken Quesadillas, YES!!  Plus $4 or $5 for a mile high pile of Green Chile  Chicken Nachos?  YES!!!  And if you really want a treat...$9 for 3 huge fillet Mignon Tacos.  Plus COLD BEER both bottle and tap plus reasonable mixed drink prices.  Place is friendly, bar plays classic rock, most patrons seem to be regulars...once you eat there, you will be too!  Friendly staff especially Hostess Judith and the young man with the red hair.  I've been in the restaurant  related business for 30 years, the prime phrase is CONSISTANCY and the food, atmosphere and friendly people are always consistant.  Consistantly great.  The owner, Andrew, always makes a point to great everybody.  New Orleans Bartender exudes Southern Hospitality.  Regular Menu is a bit pricey, portions could be larger, but food is great."
5,"I love this place. My gf and I go every time we visit her parents in north scottsdale. 

Pro's
quick and easy. good service. clean. good food. good management. not too expensive. they also post nutrition info on their menu (that alone is laudable). 

cons,

the salad dressing is quite sharp."
5,"I really (REALLY) like The Lodge so I was gonna give it 4 stars. To be honest though, I really can't think of any good reason NOT to give it that 5th star.

I've mostly been here for Happy Hour when visiting AZ, but I've also stopped in a few late nights, and have always had a good time.

The Lodge has one of the best Happy Hours (deal wise) in Old Town. All apps (except the mac & cheese and fried pickles) are half off along w/$2 cheap drafts, $3 Lodge signature drafts (which is a tasty beer) & $3 wells (stuck to beer on this last trip, but if I recall in the past they actually use a heavy pour during happy hour).

I've tried quite a few of the apps, and they're all good. The pretzels & cheese are particularly tasty. I always get pretzels & cheese no matter where I am w/the friend I came here w/for happy hour the last time I was here so I can say I've tried quite a few in my day & the Lodge's ranks right up there!

I admit I'm a sucker for cheesy theme bars, so I kind of of dig the ski lodge theme here. the dining room area isn't huge, but is clean w/comfy seats. The bar area is pretty big & the patio is nice, weather permitting. 

I've never had an issue w/the service here & both bartenders & bouncers are always nice."
5,Brought a friend from Louisiana here.  She says that the crawfish etouffee here is the best she's had outside of Louisiana!
5,"Both of my girls have been enrolled in Marilyn's studio and it has been a wonderful experience for our family.  The teachers are engaging and creative and as a result both of my girls love to dance and my eldest daughter who is now 11 has been dancing with them since the age of 3.  No stage moms here, but rather a warm, friendly environment where girls can develop their dance abilities free from the high pressure nature of some studios.  Our family looks forward to many more recitals to come.  Thanks Marilyn Bostic Ballet Centre for helping develop our daughters' confidence and love for dance!"
5,"Great product! I was on a mission to make homemade mozzarella with the absolute best ingredients I could find. Organic, whole, raw milk -  this certainly did the trick! We'll be going back that's for sure!"
5,"Simple but really great cajun food prepared in steamers right in front of you.  Selections include gumbo, pan roasts (a tomato-based broth with chunks of seafood), or seafood creole all with your choice of shrimp, crab, chicken, crawfish, oysters, or all five, with rice. They also have fresh oysters, jumbo shrimp cocktails, salads, and tasty seafood chowder, as well as the occasional lobster special. I've been probably 20 times and still never had a bad dish. The staff is friendly and helpful, and will adjust the spiciness of the dishes to your taste. By far the best option at the Talking Stick resort.

As another reviewer noted, this restaurant is really just a bar with a couple of tables, stuck right off the casino floor. This is definitely not a fine dining spot, with the clanging of slot machines and dead-eyed gamblers shuffling around fifteen feet away. Still, it's definitely worth a visit to Talking Stick. At $10-12 for lunch portions and $17-19 for huge dinner servings, and $25 for a massive platter of oysters, shrimp, crab, mussels, and clams, it's a fantastic value for the quality and tastiness of the food.  Good, reasonably priced seafood can be hard to come by in the valley, but this spot is a gem."
5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this office!  During my high-risk pregnancy I spent a lot of time at this office and in the hospital.  Both Dr. Hahn and Dr. Spieker were fantastic, very knowledgable and easy to talk to.  I trust them completly as they did everything to ensure both myself and my baby were well taken care of.   I have since seen Dr. Cyr for a quick appointment whom is very sweet."
5,"Fast, friendly, and clean.  You don't get to say that too often when describing a post office!  Serously though, these guys are great."
5,"Went here for the first time last week and had a great experience. The restaurant was very clean, the service was great. The best part? The food. I've been in AZ for 10 years now and I can say without a doubt that its some of the best food I've had in a restaurant (and this from a pregnant woman no less ;)

I had the fried chicken tenders, cheesy grits and fried okra. First, the food came out piping hot, I mean steaming and hot to the touch. The batter on the chicken was thick and crispy. The grits were cooked to perfection- dry enough to hold together a bit but still moist. And the okra was fantastic, too. It didn't hurt that my fresh lemonade came in a mason jar, either. 

I will be back. a lot :)"
5,"As one of my fave restaurant's in Scottsdale, the Herb Box is the perfect place for a great patio and lunch. At dinner the atmosphere is subtly romantic with string lights illuminating the patio. Other than the ambiance, the food is some of the best fresh local food I've tasted. A personal favorite is the Free Range Chicken with Goat Cheese... Can you say tasty? My mouth waters just thinking about it. Walking in, the crew at the Herb Box is some of the friendliest you'll ever meet (and the funniest). When you go, make sure to save room for dessert... the cheesecake of the moment is always a win!"
5,"Just went for my first time last night with ""the ""girls"". Two of us heard about it and after I read the reviews and checked out the menu it was slated for our next night out.
Anyway we had a memorable evening with wine, the make-your-own cheeseboard and the to-die-for pear and gorganzola flatbread pizza. It was topped with fried sage leaves -- different and delicious. Afterward we were able to fit dessert and shared a huge slice of fresh layer cake filled and frosted with dark chocolate. Sublime! Can't wait to go back and try other dishes - definitely made it to my 'Restaurants to Frequent' list :)"
5,"OK, yeah, everyone LOVES teriyaki, we know!

Well, don't so quickly dismiss the other absolutely AMAZING dishes served here!  It may look like a little pre-processed Japanese hole in the wall from the outside, but they're a die hard home-made mom and pop your mouth full of great food establishment!

I'd highly recommend trying the Katsu bowl! You can hardly find ANY kind of Japanese katsu in AZ, yet they have an excellent one that's very traditional, but not too expensive! I'd love to explain the mystique of this dish, but too many people think that fried egg with onions and leeks topped over a diced pork cutlet that's coated in panko bread crumbs is too strange to be palatable.  Well, to them I say you should educate your tongue, and expose it to some delicious culture! 

There's also Orange chicken... This dish is completely the bee's knees. It easily and without remorse makes Panda Express look like a burnt out oil can that a homeless person decided to cook some chicken in over a pile of burning newspapers.

Their house beef? Spicy garlic brown sauce and beef with mushrooms? Heaven.  Simple and delicious.

And I haven't even mentioned their coup de grace yet.  Their fried rice might seem a little ""heavy"" on the surface as it's lightly fried with some garlic oil, but it outclasses all competitors.  Paired with their lightly fried shrimp, it's sweet garlic love.  Seriously, their fried rice is the Sean Connery of fried rices.

As I've been eating here for far longer than I'd like to admit, I'd have to say I might be a little biased.  But, for the great unique quality and cheap price, I guarantee you're not going to find any better in AZ!"
5,"I went to Tommy V's for dinner last night with my husband and several of his clients...WOW!  This is my new favorite restaurant in town!  They have a private dining area that they can close off with curtains and turn the music off, which is perfect for a business dinner.  I am vegan, one of his clients is doing the paleo diet, and another is gluten free, and they had DELICIOUS options for all of us, while also serving AMAZING pasta and fish dishes to others at the table.  I can't recommend this restaurant enough.  I am just sorry I haven't discovered it earlier.  YUM! YUM! YUM!  P.S.  Very cool atmosphere, too!"
5,"This wasn't the first time, but we went to Tutti Santi for a family Christmas Eve Dinner.  All I have to say is that everything was simply perfect.  Not only the food, but the service.  Which to me makes a restaurant with great food go from good to great.  

I ate the lamb shank- Angello Dorato, which fell off the bone and was delicious. I cleaned the plate. 

Dad had the veal marsala with fettuccine alfredo.  The veal was fantastic and the alfredo was just right. The sauce was not too thick-not to thin.  Dad cleaned the plate.  From him being in the food industry for 30+years and eating in many italian establishments both here and Chicago, believe me that says more than alot.   

Mom had the special of the night, which was a cioppino with tons of seafood.  When most italian restaurants serve this dish at least one of the seafood items will be rubbery or fishy tasting (not in a good way) especially the mussels.  Not here. Everything was the way it should be. I felt this was the plate of the evening out of 3 great dishes.   Mom didn't clean the plate, she has a small stomach.  But I will be eating the leftovers in about two hours after I sleep off my meal.

Everything from the bread, the calamari fritti, to the tiramisu was fabulous.  I'm glad we couldn't get reservations anywhere else for this special meal.
  
Gratzi and Buon Natale.

Oh yeah, I didn't get the raviolis this time, but if you've haven't had them it's a must try."
5,"Best Italian restaurant in the valley, as far as I'm concerned. Totally unassuming from the outside since it's in a strip center on 64th St. & Greenway (in the same center as Fry's and McDonalds). But this family run restaurant that has been here for years. Same friendly staff every time...especially love being in the bar area. A little on the pricey side, but definitely worth it. Must try the ravioli (either as an appetizer or main dish) and chicken Marsala with fettuccine Alfredo on the side. All entrees come with soup or salad."
5,"Tried a little if everything.  The bars are worth the drive across town unbelievably good.  The bars have a moist short bread crust, it is absolutely addictive.  The strawberry cupcake was perfection.  Cookies were very good but the bars and cup cakes stole the show.  Thank heavens it is not closer to home :)"
5,"Best breakfast in the valley. Dinner sucks. Well, let's clarify a bit here. We've ordered blueberry pancakes, stuffed french toast, muffins, and a few other b-fast items. They were all stupidly good. For dinner, we've tried a couple dishes such as the recommended jumbalaya - SUCKS! Stay away from that canned garbage. Back to breakfast...dang, that's incredible!"
5,"Found this place through Yelp and a Yelping buddy so there you have it...the power of Yelp because we absolutely LOVED this place.  Tucked into a neighborhood you have a very cozy, eclectic little joint.  From the start to the end we received extremely friendly service. We of course tried the foods suggested in previous reviews and by the server.  The pasta fries were unique, light and paired with great tasting sauces.  A definite dish you have to try.  We also tried the figs stuffed with chorizo.  Also very good & savory.  But the ABSOLUTE FAVORITE of the night were the chicken and waffles!  My gosh is this the dish to come to the Tuck Shop for.  The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.  The waffles were served with a butter that seemed to be whipped with possibly honey and the syrup was just the right sweet.  All the flavors seemed to work with just the right amount of sweet and savory.  The grilled fresh green beans were the perfect side.  I think I would get this dish over and over and over again.  Then I would go back and get it again.  
Great place we will frequent often.  

P.S. They make their own tonic.  Yep, their own tonic.  GREAT tasting!  Try it with the vodka they serve (haven't heard of it before but was very pleased)."
5,"Dim lighting. Fleet Foxes. Beautiful upstairs seating that almost seems secret. Band of Horses. Benches that are less cushy than you anticipate them to be. The Shins. Black board specials, just because they look cool. Beirut. $13 vegetable dishes. 

Intimidated yet? Fight through the angst. Once you take your first bite of food, all the hullabaloo will be well worth it.

Order the forbidden rice bowl. Tell them to make it vegan (the vegetables are usually cooked in a bit of butter)... after all, you're a pseudo-hipster for the evening, and it's fantastic. If you're depressed by the idea of black rice as your main carbohydrate, the flat breads are taste-gasmic. That crust... the things I'd do for unlimited amounts of that flat bread crust. Top it off with figs and ricotta, and there's no way I'm passing up a square or two... or seven. If you're still not sold on the idea of carb-loading, the salmon ""superfood"" is delicious and nutritious, and who's not into a little super(food)iority now and then?

But on to the main event... the chocolate stout cake + spiced ice cream + espresso ganache was the best chocolate cake I've ever had. It was just so damn... moist. There, I said it. Moist. Moist. Moist. Ew. But really, yum. If caffeine, chocolate and alcohol don't suit your fancy (wimp), the cheesecake in a jar was equally delightful. Cookie crust + strawberry compote + cream + cheesecake. Layered. In a jar. Who thought of that? Someone with adorable thoughts, that's who. 

And let's be honest, you've earned dessert. I mean... you ordered a healthy, vegan entree over the french onion cheeseburger, right? Right. Of course you did."
5,"my son loves the splash pad! His dad or uncles stay with him at the playground while I can run in the store or two that I need to! There are quite a few empty retail spots, hopefully they can get some new stores in there as well,"
5,"I booked our anniversary trip to the Westin Kierland through Priceline.  It was so reasonably priced that I was a bit concerned it would lack quality, and after reading a few reviews on Trip Advisor I was worried.  I was COMPLETELY wrong.  This is a 5 star resort from the moment you park your car.  The front desk staff upgraded our room, and this very nice gentleman greeted us with a smile every single time we passed through the lobby.  They have golf carts available to drive you to your rental car.  The food in Deseo is amazing.  I would definitely recommend trying the ceviche sampler and the muddled cocktails.  I can't forget to mention the amazing bread made with tapioca flour, they will even give you the recipe. 

We especially enjoyed talking to the girls in the information center (the one that looks like a mine).  They were VERY helpful in giving us advice on local restaurants and insisting we take a day trip to Sedona......we did and Sedona is now one of our favorite cities. Thanks to Ashley, Miranda, Tiffany, Chelsea, and Pat.  When we returned from our Sedona day trip, we had chips & salsa, and two cold coronas.  This was a very thoughtful touch.

If you are looking for a fine dining experience, Mastros Ocean Club is right across the street and has incredible food.  I highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes and the seared scallops.  

Back to the resort.......our room had a great view of the golf course which was massive.  Although we are not golfers, we certainly enjoyed the view.  Our room was a pretty good size and the Heavenly Beds are my absolute favorite.  When traveling I will do my very best to ensure we stay at a Westin Resort."
5,"Awesome! I highly recommend this place! Incredible atmosphere inside and out, the bar design is superb and the patio is the perfect spot for relaxing and enjoying drinks with friends. I went for the second time recently and have to give this place a stellar review. The menu is innovative and fresh! The mixed drinks are killer and the wine on tap was an extremely pleasant surprise. Plus, you can't beat their happy hour seven days a week! 

 I have had the crab cake BLT and the halibut sandwich, which were both out of this world! Everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked amazing and I can't wait to go back and try all the others.  The servers were great and knowledgeable about their menu which is always a big plus! As a parent, I love that this place is a perfect day/night out spot for a date or hanging with friends but also a family oriented neighborhood joint where I can bring my kiddo along! Love that Churn is right next door to get some yummy dessert after an incredible meal!  The design is spot on for this area! Great job!"
5,"Joe's is truly a special place!! What makes this place so awesome is that you literally feel like you stepped back into an American farmhouse situated somewhere in the 1940's. The employees are fully compitent in their abilities and they seem happy to work there. They have homemade root beer, which is very tasty and leaves a smooth and flavorful aftertaste. They also serve Barq's Red Cream soda from tap, which is impossible to find anywhere in the southwest. The outdoor dining area has benches in a picnic style setting, while the indoor dining area features a vintage John Deere tractor as the center piece. The side dishes are kind of small (one scoop), so you might want to opt for and extra side...the mac and cheese rocks!! I also recommend getting cornbread or lemon cake for desert!!"
5,"I ordered my custom made door and it arrived recently for installation. The design was exactly to specifications, quality of construction and the finish are flawless. It took several months to get but it was worth it. This one improvement has increased the value of my home and makes my entire family feel safer."
5,"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here for the first time. I have nothing but good things to say. Food, wait staff and overall experience were excellent. This is an old school type of steakhouse with red velvet wallpaper, leather booths, etc. If you haven't been, I can't recommend it highly enough. Give it a try and you'll be glad you did!"
5,"Seriously.  I seldom give 5 stars, but it deserves at least this much.
If it wasn't for the location and the super scary after dinner club scene, I would go every.single.day.

Truly one the best BBQ places in greater Phoenix.  My mouth is watering as I'm thinking about the Hog Heaven special.  In fact, my puppies mouths are watering too.  Decent prices, giant selection.  One of those places where the early cowboys of the SW would appreciate.  
 
If you are a cracker family, I suggest going super early, like super early bird special early , like when the snow birds come out for the senior special early, because after dusk, the whole place transforms into a pulsating super loud, super dicey Mexican Dance Club, and the blue hairs are sure to have a coronary attack after indulging in such a  lipid laden meal as they attempt to make their way out of the Club.  
 
Ah the sacrifice for decent BBQ...."
5,"this place rules, plain and simple

just wish they had a cheaper jukebox"
5,Best Ice cream sandwhich I have ever had
5,"This place is great!
If you talk to anybody they have a suggestion for a great flavor.
You can bring in food from another place to enjoy and just enjoy a great atmosphere.
With the music that someone has an issue with you can just talk to the DJ to get a suggestion they are MORE than accommodating.
They have a great happy hour prices! 
Overall great prices, great people, and a great time! If you have the right mind :)"
5,"I remember when this was Fry's...back in the 70's. I think it's great when these older buildings are put to good use instead of being torn down for another new strip mall. What a perfect place for an Antique Mall.

This is a store that you could spend hours and hours really looking at everything. This Antique Mall has TONS of GREAT Antique finds...like REAL antique and retro STUFF, not recent overpriced crap that most Antique Dealers throw in their booth and try to pass off as something worth a lot of money. There are things here that I haven't ever seen at other Antique stores before.

I quickly walked down the aisles, the prices seemed pretty good and yet some that seemed OVERPRICED. I wonder if Antique Dealers are wanting to sell merchandise or pay monthly rent to store their museum. Believe it or not, you can still get BETTER deals on ebay.

Several of the booths seemed like they had a theme, like stepping back into that time era... they were merchandised nicely.

The restroom even looked like some grandmother's tacky bathroom decor, it really fit in well with the antique feeling.

I will definitely come back here when I have more time to shop.

5,"Gymboree, many years ago I brought my first son to Gymboree quite often and really enjoyed.  Never thought I would be back, but now we have another gymboree tike and he loves it.  

I am very happy to have been reintroduced to Gymboree and have already made plans to go again with my son next week.  The instructor made it look easy and really communicated very well with both parents and children. 

Thinking about Gymboree now, my only regret is that I know someday my boy is going to outgrow it, and I want these times to last forever."
5,"I indulged big time at Indulge Burgers & More during Fat Tuesday yesterday.  There are a tremendous variety, including many healthy options such as a turkey or veggie burger.  The best part I like is that you can build your own burger with all sorts of yummy toppings.  I had the turkey burger, and the turkey was one of the best I have ever tasted.  Sometimes you can taste like of the darker meats and fatty parts, but I felt like this burger was very clean and lean.  I would highly recommend the sweet potatoe fries that you can order.  You can deep those fries in what tastes like a warm marshamallow dip.   The price is not too bad either for what I call a luxury burger."
5,"i tried the thai river noodles. they will not replace the love i have for a dan dan noodle bowl. but the thai noodles, they were good.

i like this place because it has really opened hours compared to everything else around here. and the food in inconsistent. oh also, the new soda machines are very entertaining. just watch....

this is usually a last resort option (everything else in the area is closed). but it is a good one nonetheless."
5,"Yelpers,  have a question. If menus and prices vary by location, help this CA transplant figure out the best ones to try! Thanks, I've heard such good things about Sonic but have only been to the Anaheim and Hemet, CA ones while visiting."
5,"My sister and I went here the other week and got gel manicures! They turned out beautiful and lasted forever! Ithink Biagio is now my go to nail salon! 

Keep it up!"
5,"We stopped here on a Thursday night on a raving referral and they we not exaggerating - this place is fantastic!
We are always a little hesitant to try a new place when an omnivore suggests it, but as vegetarians, we found Sekong by Night so accommodating! They offered to convert nearly any dish on their menu into a vegan alternative, and it was delicious. The spring rolls are really big, and they swapped their fish dipping sauce for a vegan version. We had the Phnom Penh Noodle Soup with tofu & veggie broth (just like the Vietnamese pho!) and the Katheaw Cha rice noodles with tofu instead of beef - AMAZING. 
Service was top notch, and as many other reviewers noted their prices are unbelievably low for the quantity and quality of food that you get.
Looking forward to our next visit and trying more fantastic dishes!"
5,"Excellent in every way.  Attentive and fun owners who tend bar every weekend night - GREAT live music, excellent wine selection.   Keeping Fountain Hills young.... one weekend at a time."
5,"Four Peaks baby.  This spot is awesome.  Great place to meet up with a crowd, grub, and pound some craft brew.  The food is great: dope appetizers , rockin' burgers, decent pizza, and daily specials.  The beer is fantastic, hop knot being my fave.  They have happy hour everday from 3-7 and 10-close with dollar off beers, a light night menu, TV's, and a pool table.  I've gotten mashed here more than a few times.  Sunday brunch is killer, and may I suggest you try the Stout milkshake, a little known secret, but good for the sweet toof.  Don't miss out on the Peaks."
5,"Wow, Chill rocks. Frank and his lovely wife, the proprietors, are fantastic. The prices are super low and the gelato/sorbet is awesome. While we were there, a little kid dropped the top part of his cone on the ground. Frank replaced it for free. 

Then he gave us a sample of the fat-free, sugar-free chocolate sorbet, which made me want to buy a pint of it... after I had already eaten a baby sized Mango/Pomegranate mix. Yum. 

How about this: Go have dinner/lunch/breakfast/whatever at Pita Jungle, then walk across the parking lot to Chill for dessert. That sounds like the perfect evening."
5,"I would be beside myself if Grinders closed. It's about time I wrote a review, since I'm a regular. I can be found sitting on one of the giant chairs surfing on the wi-fi many mornings.

I'm the one who brought the plants in. I used to water them a couple times a week but nowadays I'm lazy and they really need to be repotted. I should get on that ...

The music is always playing and everyone knows my regular drink ... they've continued to memorize it for me even as I started to slowly decrease the fat & calories of my regular order. Now it's an ice skim latte with sugar free vanilla. I used to get an Everything bagel with egg, cheese and potatoes most mornings. Now I get it on multigrain toast. Eh, it's the little things.

The coffee at Grinders is really really good. It's not bitter and sharp, it's smooth. They grind their beans outside many mornings per week. Sometimes it gets too warm inside during the winter so we prop the doors open, but if the grinder is going outside, it'll blow coffee bean fumes in the door.

There's some retired motorcycle cops who meet up every morning and sit around the big round table. They often park their motorcycles in front of the place together. They call themselves the Geezerados.

There's sometimes a few right-wingers having conversations mid-day. One time I listened to their meeting and heard them trying to come up with controversial topics to get people to come to church. They spent a long time trying to figure out who could get them proof that global warming isn't happening, so they could use that as their hook.

A lot of moms come in with their kids. Seeing siblings piled up in one of the oversized chairs together is common. There are a few regulars who come in specifically to sit on the internet all day. I'm not there all day, but I'm there at all times of the day because I have a home office, and you never know when you suddenly need caffeine.

Early in the morning and after 3pm the place becomes flooded with Sunnyslope High School kids. They range from ROTC kids wearing pickle suits to trendy girls in neon to the alternative crowd. They often lay around the couch splayed across each other or gazing into each others' eyes. 

Ordinarily I'm a real talker and I can't usually keep my mouth shut, but Grinders is the one place that I go where I barely make a peep. I just eavesdrop on everyone's conversations and sometimes run into friends I know. I usually go before my brain is fully awake in the morning, that's part of it. For the record, a couple months ago one of the girls there said I was practically invisible and she hardly knew I was there, because I was so quiet.

There's nothing pretentious about Grinders at all, and it's also down to earth without being ghetto. It has character. Some months the art is better than other months. Hannah has been there for years (they call her Big Hannah now, only because there's another girl named Hannah who is tiny and they call her Little Hannah) and Hannah rocks and makes the best breakfast ever. 

I can ride my bike in the morning and be wearing my pajamas and not have anyone really bat an eye. That's the beauty of Grinders. I've seen other people come in wearing their pajamas, too. It's a little bit like the cafeteria in a college dorm, except the people are of all ages and we live down the street from each other instead of down the hall from each other.

Grinders has a location inside the John C. Lincoln hospital across the street, too. It's common to see the hospital workers walk in wearing their scrubs. I think they're also opening one at Devry, or they just did. I was frustrated to hear that they tried to open a location at the Art Institute but they were one week too late, Stupid Starbucks had just gotten there. LAME!"
5,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about the food, or the view? I know, I'll share the best part about my amazing birthday dinner at Elements -- meeting Executive Chef Beau Macmillian. 

He didn't duck away when we made eye contact in the hallway, instead he broke away from his staff and came right up and introduced himself. He was so incredibly personable. He could have easily ignored us. I'm sure he's approached on a regular basis now that he's such a TV personality. But instead, he chatted us up and he talked about how he was so inspired by Asian food and how he wanted to bring that influence into his food and to Arizona. Before we knew it he was taking us in to see the latest renovations to Elements' kitchen! 

He proudly showed off the latest upgrades. Sure, there were new gadgets, but he even included skylights because his sous chefs said they hated never seeing the light of day. How cool is that?

And to be revealed next month is an expansion to the kitchen that includes a table for 12 INSIDE the kitchen. Not a new concept for restaurants, but something Chef Macmillian is so excited about. There's no doubt that the food that he cranks out can be intimidating, but his latest endeavor speaks to his desire of having his guests witness the artistry behind the kitchen doors. This new addition promises to give you a full sensory experience BEFORE the plate even reaches your table -  from seeing, smelling and hearing what's happening in the kitchen to finally tasting the finished product. Talk about mouth watering.    

Here's hoping that I will one day get to sit at that table."
5,"The sushi was fresh and excellent! The service was almost too fast. I did not find the prices to be out of line with the quality.  Our daughter loved the miso soup. The one thing I really appreciated is that they will make what you want, whether it is on the menu or not. If they have it, you can get it. I know we'll be going there often. 

One thing though, this is a busy, noisy place. It is not large either. If you are looking for quite and relaxed, this perhaps isn't the best choice. If you want good food in a noisy cheerful atmosphere, like a bunch of friends or after work, this fits the bill."
5,"Recently was invited to this restaurant & found out that they have children's plates for adults or any age.

It was SUPER CHEAP & it included a drink with refills like tea or soda etc.

What a deal!

Under 5. bucks including the drink.

I will definitely  be going back  to any Cracker Barrel who has this deal because it is cheaper than fast food etc. or just about anywhere."
5,Love it here. Come regularly now lol thanks to everyone on yelp. Great food cheap price great service. Tho not 100 percent authentic Chinese food still great
5,My favorite place in the world to eat! Great service and awesome food!
5,"When I was a dancer I always came here for everything. Shoes, leotards, skirts, and accessories. They have every type of dance shoe and a wide variety of everything dancers need and want. 

I'm not sure how many dance shops are in the area, but all of my instructors always recommended this place which is not very close to our studio. The staff is all very kind and knowledgeable which trust me is a very good thing. Dance shoes can get confusing! There are at least three different kind of tap shoes! 

Dee's also has costume rentals so if you ever need a crazy costume at the last minute Dee's can help you out with that too!"
5,"Wow this place is fabulous.  Everything is so fresh and tasty that you can enjoy a healthy and yummy meal without breaking the bank.  The salad bar is huge and they have a fresh soup bar where you can choose numerous varieties of homemade soups.  Great tasting desserts and frozen yogurt machine.  Best Strawberry Lemonade I have ever tasted.  You have to try this place you will not be disappointed.  They need to open locations in the Midwest.

Also, I want to give a shout out to the server at the restaurant.  His name is Oscar and he is so wonderful and funny.  He made us all laugh and smile and Oscar is such a hard worker and everyone that visits this location has to say hello to Oscar because he is the nicest man ever!"
5,"Went wed nite, wife tells me best gnocchi since Europe, were cooked perfectly . I had pollo erbe, terrific.

 "" wine tasting director"" very good, with tasty selections. Will be back, OFTEN. Highly recommend. Rich D"
5,"What can I say ?  This is awesome.  I am a donut fan and would give Dunkin 4 stars, just like this place.  Great variety, great coffee, fresh donuts.  The extra 1 star comes for the fluffiness of their dough.  Its very fluffy and its done just right.  

Dunkin is good but its donuts will taste a little hard and ""old"" when they have been sitting for a while.  For some reason, the Bosa donuts dun get too hard, even after U buy and drive for like 1/2 hour home.  I know its not located in the best part of town, but they are open 24 hrs and there is a drive thru.  They accept credit cards and discover :)"
5,"While I love that it is Native American owned and operated, the best thing about this restaurant is the food - as it should be.  I don't go out to eat to be entertained or charmed - just fed better than I could be at home and that is exactly what this place does.  

The food is amazing. The fry bread isn't greasy and I don't know how they do that.  The meals are flavorful, filling, and reasonably priced.  The only thing I would do is add some tomatoes to the tacos but that is a minor quibble.  

If you want to go out for a delicious meal in a casual place and not pay a lot for it, GO NOW to the Fry Bread House."
5,"Yup. It's all true. Great food, super charming place, very intimate. 

We sat outside on the patio under a heat lamp. Enjoyed the olives as a starter, as well as some fried raviolis (yes, please) and a caprese salad app.  Outstanding artisan pizza, with as good a crust as I've ever had, and homemade mozzarella. Wine was just ok, but very reasonable. Server was attentive, helpful and friendly. Owner came by a couple times to check in on us and was absolutely delightful. 

Deduct a point for the proximity to the Handlebar J Saloon and the faux-cowboys arriving in limos with 10-gallon hats. Then add a point back for the near-fight we got to watch between a biker and the faux-cowboy who almost hit him with his Cadillac.

We'll be back, and with more friends."
5,Went to Cracker Barrel twice while vacationing at our home in Litchfield Park.  All the food we ordered were very good and the service was good also.  I highly recommend their pancakes.
5,"Barrio Cafe is an amazing Mexican restaurant.  Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza travels to Mexico for many of her ingredients and you can tell - things are always fresh (they only have an ice cream freezer!), creative and authentic.  I am more than content w/ a mango margarita, the incredible guacamole and the gooey caramel filled churros!!  Even when the restaurant is packed, the staff is friendly and informative."
5,"My boyfriend and I stopped by to grab a bite to eat before work and long story short
-Greeted immediately 
-Lots of variety
-Meat lovers pizza is amazing
-Ask for Tawnya she's really nice and a wonderful server 
-Will be back, loved the excellent service!!"
5,We love Dr Steve!
5,"I originally came here because I heard they have a gluten free menu--i expected one or two pizzas, probably cheese and one other choice. But they have a FULL menu of pizzas, salads, and appetizers that are gluten free. and they are DELICIOUS! 

Pizza was my absolute favorite food in my past, gluten-filled life. Anything from Slices to Pizzaria Bianco. I have tried gluten free pizzas almost everywhere you can find them, and they are always too dry, too thin, too soggy, or completely different flavor than what pizza crust should taste like.

 Picazzo's gluten free pizza is delicious, the crust is pretty thick and has a good texture, not like a big saltine cracker as most places tend to be. the flavor is true to pizza crust! my friends even like it so much they will split a gluten free pizza with me instead of ordering 'regular' crust.

There is also a range of appetizers that are delicious, caprese salad with gluten free bread and the spinach dip are my faves. 

The employees are all very nice and aware of gluten intolerance--they check with you before they bring you additional food items or before putting GF and non-GF foods together in your to go box. 

I love it. If you are gluten or wheat intolerant and  you like pizza, this will be your new favorite place. Totally worth the drive, and the money. But the prices are very reasonable for GF food!"
5,"Love this place! Just went here and ordered the petite filet and lobster tail, everything is so good here. I also love the pork chop! My favorite dessert is the lava cake hot and yummy."
5,The folks here are the best!
5,"I love this place. It is one of my favorite Antique shops in the city! There is a wide selection and variety of booths and items. There is everything here from match boxes, cute purses and hats to retro/vintage furniture, wacky mannequins, old cameras and old toys to reminiscence over. And! They are decently priced and have a nice helpful staff."
5,"Really?  Because it doesn't get any better than this.  For what it is and for what it's worth this place is truly unique.  A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place, this quaint spot serves up good, tasty, and satisfying food hot from the kitchen.

What is a pasty?

A pasty's history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the ""handles"" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.

At the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.

Pros
* Good food
* Originality
* Portions
* Customer service
* Coat hooks at the bar

Cons
* Small interior"
5,"The Culinary Dropout , you get the best of both worlds. The food is off the hook (it's great) ,the service, these ladie's and guy's take care of your every need, and as a added bonus you have some of the best performers in Phoenix, entertaining you while you dinne.....Check it out....Bluesman Mike"
5,"Eden's Grill has to be one of my favorite, and newly discovered Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant in the PHX metro. Located in a sleepy strip mall, close to Artie's Ace, is EG. My partner and I had the opportunity to have dinner here a few weeks ago and we were totally wowed by everything! We started off with the hummus, followed by two orders of the vegetarian plate. The vegetarian plates were huge and featured dolmades, falafel, rice, veggie skewers and veggie patties (2). The vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious. Next time we'll pay the extra $5 and split one Vegetarian Plate instead of getting two. The pita and hummus were fresh and delicious, however, I find EG's hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus. Overall, I would totally recommend EG to anyone with an itch for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food but be warned, they aren't open for lunch on the weekends yet."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Had the buttermilk fried chicken with the mashed sweet potatoes and asparagus and it is to die for. Comfort food for sure. Not too crazy about their brunch menu because you must order off of that and not the regular menu. Their guacamole and warm chips are also a yummy must! This is a great place to take out of town guests because there is nothing like it anywhere else.
5,"This place has to get all five stars. Ok, the area is a little suspect I will admit; that can be countered with the excellent food and excellent prices. This is the kind of food that goes for $12 - $15/plate if it were located in an upscale area.  They have done a great job with the interior and the food is really wonderful.

5 Top reasons I love La Condesa:
 ~ Beautiful food. Unique flavors. 
 ~ Great salsa bar: aver a dozen lovely hand made salsas; I liked them all
 ~ Price: you can spend under $7 and have a really good meal
 ~ Convelient: It is only a 2 minute drive from 24th & Camelback.
 ~ Atmosphere: the interior and the service create a great place to dine.

***We eat out several times a week, and this place is now at the top of the list for my wife and I both.***"
5,"I am a transplanted Midwesterner, so I love me some breakfast.  And by breakfast I mean:  Hashbrowns, sausage, bacon, pancakes, and biscuits and gravy.  

Mike and Rhonda's makes a mean breakfast with huge portions.  For $7 you can have bacon/sausage/ham with hashbrowns, 2 eggs, and biscuits & gravy/pancakes/toast.  Come hungry or share.

They also serve classic american lunch fare:  burgers, chicken strips, fries, meatloaf, etc."
5,"These are the best, most consistent donuts in the valley.  I was always a fan of the Chandler location, so I tried this location as soon as it opened.  I was pleased that the donuts were as fresh and as varied as the other location.

I don't care if people go to dunkin for the coffee..a donut shop is about the donuts, and I haven't yet had any donuts in the valley in the same league as BoSa."
5,"My boyfriend and I decided to try Boulders out last night because we wanted some good beer and it's within walking distance of my condo. Good choice on our behalf! 

We arrived around 10:30 pm, so we took advantage of reverse happy hour ($1 off most pints on draft). They were also having half price pizza night, but we had already eaten pizza earlier in the evening, so we did not get a chance to try the pizza. Had we been hungry, it seemed like a great deal.

I was VERY impressed by their beer list! They had the biggest beer selection I've seen anywhere. When I was shopping at a specialty store last week, I noticed a ""Maui Brewing Co. Coconut Porter"" that l was very curious to try - but I passed it up because it was $10 for a 4-pack (ouch). I asked the bartender at Boulders (Rob) if they happened to have that specific beer - and to my utter surprise they did! I was happy I was able to try it out before shelling out ten bucks to buy a four pack at the store. Two thumbs up! 

Speaking of Rob the bartender, he was great. Very fast to take care of all the customers around us as well as my boyfriend and I. Made sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive. 

Overall, I had a really good first experience at Boulders on Broadway, and I will definitely be back. I dug the old-school ambiance with the wood paneled bar, we received very good service, and the selection of beer was amazing - truly something for everyone. 

If you live in the area, I'd recommend checking it out!
I plan to get some friends together and go back for one of their ""team trivia nights"" soon - sounds like a blast."
5,"Took us a while to find a good Greek restaurant. We have been here many times and have yet to have a bad meal.

Gyro combo this trip. Meat was very flavorful and great texture. Tzatziki sauce is one of the best I've tasted."
5,"I love boba drinks but hate the word ""boba"". I always feel like an ape when I say that word. 
 
Anyways.

There was a period where I use to drink this stuff at least 3 times a week when I was living in San Francisco, so when I say I love something, I really do (or is it more like a creepy obsession?) So! When I found a boba place here I got excited, especially when I saw that they had green milk tea.

I can't vouch for all of their drinks, as I've only tried the green milk tea and avocado snow, but every time I have ordered them they have been super good."
5,"I love the urban feel of this place, and the swanky Apple Store is a big enough draw for me! The place is brand new, so not too many things are going on yet, but more stores are opening all the time! There's now a really high-end iPic movie theater, a frozen yogurt place, a great Nike store, and much more to come in addition to H&M, West Elm, and the delicious Oakville Grocery Co. 
Parking is fine and it's easy to navigate. When you're done here you can walk to Kierland across the street, too! :)
Can't wait to see what they do here in a few years!"
5,First time eating Chicken and waffles and it was the best time ever.
5,"Why everyone in the valley doesn't use this service is beyond me.  They carry every quality pet food manufactured, their prices are competitive, they deliver...FREE... no matter how small the order...right to your door....what a deal.

 I've used Goober for a couple of years they have never missed a delivery, never been late.  Great customer service, and the ladies that answer the phone really know their stuff!  Have a pet with allergies... This is your place for quality pet food, they will aldo have lots a good suggestions on your pets diet."
5,"Amazing greek food! Definitely try the greek fries!  I always try to come here every time I am in Phoenix.  Staff is also always very friendly!

Also try the greek calamari.  Unusually delicious!"
5,"So much food for so little money, and they have kids meals that the kids will actually eat.  If you do not like what they offer in the cafeteria you can get food downstairs like Pizza and hotdogs...what kid does not like Pizza or a hotdog?

I had the meatballs and mashed potatoes and they were so good.  I wish there was something bad to say about eating in a furniture store cafeteria, but there really is not - it was great food, great service and fun for the kids (there is a play area with a TV that they can eat at too (so the parents can enjoy their food too)

My wife had the herb chicken and it looked great too, and she said it was really tasty too.  She loved it.  The desserts were amazing too, and very filling --- SO MUCH FOOD for SO LITTLE THE MONEY!

I wish it was not so far away from Queen Creek, or I would hit it up so much more often!"
5,"This location opened up just 3 weeks ago, and offers high quality, natural products for mainly cats and dogs, although there is a very basic small animal section.  The emphasis is on foods that are more nutritious, healthier, and that don't have corn or soy in them. There is a large freezer section in the back with a good selection of raw food meals.  Also, there is a plethora of treats and toys for your furry friend as well.  The small animal foods section has a few small bags of hay, some treats, pellets, and toys.  I wasn't too impressed with their rabbit selection, and they did not offer high quality brands such as Oxbow which is a bit surprising since they have so many high quality dog and cat products.

Jill, the manager, was very enthusiastic and is very passionate about providing the best products for pets.  She showed me various treats, foods, and toys, and provided a lot of educational material on dog nutrition and health.  She provided a free sample of some nice grain-free dry dog kibble which is highly recommended on dogfoodadvisor.com, which I appreciated a lot since my dog is a bit picky with the food he eats.  This is definitely a place to go to spoil and pamper your dog or cat!"
5,"Wow.

Been there 2 times.  I wanted to revisit to see if it was a fluke, and to my pleasant surprise - it wasn't.  I'm from NW Indiana originally.  I know corn.  Indiana sweet corn cannot be beat - well - until I had the corn from America's Taco Shop.  This corn has cotija cheese, hot sauce, mayo, and I swear crack.  There has to be crack in there... I have viscous dreams about that corn and wake up in a cold sweat.  I need that corn... it's just so good.  

I don't eat beef and that's the only meat they serve but that won't stop me.  Their vampiro's minus the carne asada, bean and cheese burritos, chips and salsa, quesadilla are all awesome.  They also have delicious horchata.... but that corn.... 

I know where I'm going tonight."
5,"Okay I have found my new favorite ""home office!""  I don't have an office for my agency yet so coffee shops tend to be where I get most of my work done.

Last week I checked out Echo Coffee for a client meeting and we both really liked it.  Today I returned and spent a few hours working at Echo Coffee on their wi-fi. It was such a nice break from my usual home office at Starbucks.  Walking into Echo Coffee you can instantly tell its a different type of coffee experience.  The environment is very relaxing, music is not blasting so customers don't have to scream over each other, and they have great big couches in the back.  Of course atmosphere and great coffee needs to be in balance and it definitely was at Echo.

The coffee is really good and love very fair price for the quality you get (my 2 favs are Cappuccino at $2.75 and $3.75 for large Chai Latte).  My chai latte came in a big ceramic mug.  I don't know about you but there is just something special enjoying coffee out of big mugs and not recyclable paper cups.

A surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good.  Can you tell I am a fan yet?  I ordered a Curry Chicken sandwich and it was huge and delicious so finished the whole thing.  There was a nice bonus on the plate - Mango Chutney so make sure you get that if you order lunch at Echo.  I would have loved just a bowl of that and bread as its flavor was so good.  I need to find out where they get this from as I want to have it at home. About $12.50 for my huge Chai tea and curry chicken sandwich."
5,Try the Moroccan Chicken on the low calorie menu.  I was really surprised at how great it is.
5,"Christy is an amazing cake artist.  She has an impressive portfolio as she has a flair for creativity.  Her cakes are amazing and are truly one-of-a-kind.  She also has several delicious cake flavors to choose from or she can create one for you.   She has made several cakes for our family and I have been impressed with everyone of them.  I was also excited to see her compete on TLC's Ultimate Cake Off show early this spring.  If you're looking for a sculpted cake or one that will be the center of attention at your next party, then I recommend you call Phoenix Cake Company."
5,"I like to think of Trader Joe's as a ""specialty food/health market."" It is simply in a league of its own when compared to large commercial grocery chains. Honestly, there is no comparison! 

With that being said, this is the BEST Trader Joe's I have been too! (and I have shopped quite a few in my travels across the US) The sheer size of this store, in TJ standards, is IMPRESSIVE!  The isles are plenty large enough for TWO people (with carts) to maneuver through.  And more importantly EVERYTHING looks fresh and delectable!  

Some of my fav's are: 

$3.99 Trader Joe's Coastal Cab...FABULOUS for the price! (Quite honestly though, I haven't EVER had a bad wine at Traders...they have an amazing selection that isn't overwhelming but isn't sparse either.) I also LOVE that they CLEARLY label each of the wines and/or regions so they are quick and easy to find! 

The Haircot Verts (French Green Beans) are simply delicious! Their Brussel Sprouts are the perfect size and quantity; just enough for two people at two different meals.  They even have Nulaid ""Ready Egg"" (i.e. egg beaters) for $3.69! At the grocery store the SAME stuff will cost you TWICE that!! 

Their cheese selection is delightful with almost ANY kind of cheese imaginable! Their artesian breads are so yummy...although not a ""low fat/fat free"" food, so that is a once every few months splurge. (and even then we only get the small loaf (which I want to say is called a ""little bastard."" That name CRACKS me up!) 

And although I am not a ""sweet"" eater, my hubs is...so he has a dozen or so goodies that he constantly gets here. The one I can think of off the top of my head are their Chocolate Covered Joe Joe's with Peppermint Crumble (or something like that.) I'd go look at the box but we are fresh out because the hubs thinks that eating one box over a two-three day period is acceptable! 

It also fun to be rewarded for bringing your own reusable bags; as any good eco-friendly shopper would do! There is a weekly drawing for a TJ's gift card (I think the value is $25) and you get a ticket when you bring your own bags. (not one for each bag...just one ticket for bringing them to put your goodies in) Then they draw a name out of all the tickets (which you drop in a box on your way out of the store) once a week.  

If you shop more than once a week, you can ""earn"" a ticket for each time you shop there in a week therefore increasing your chances of winning. (although I am PRETTY sure the majority of Surprise/Sun City Grand shop there so maybe the odds aren't THAT great! )

Regardless, this is just a great little ""market"" through and through. I used to get excited to shop at TJ's...now I am always looking for an excuse to buy something just so I can go there! (and it's not just to try and win the gift card either..that's an added bonus!)"
5,"Green....how I love thee.  Green may be vegan/vegetarian, but I certainly wouldn't claim it to be 'health' food.  Green is located in a small run down strip mall adjacent to Kore Bicycles on the NW corner of Scottsdale Road and McKellips.  It doesn't look like much from the outside and without knowing of Green you probably wouldn't do a second take upon passing it, however the food here is no less than amazing!  

The decor is unique and fresh; 10-12 tables, a couch/lounge area, random artwork on the walls, painted quotes, lights hanging from the ceiling, and old painted car doors along one wall.  I've tried a random assortment of items from the menu and nothing has disappointed me...but by far my favorite is the BBQ 'Chicken' sandwich along with an appetizer of the spicy buffalo wings.  I believe the mock chicken Green uses is fungus based, Quorn perhaps (may not sound appetizing but it is freaking awesome).  I am not personally vegan, or even vegetarian for that matter but Green has me hooked.  I've 'forced' many of my meat eating friends to try Green and they have all become believers (if you could call sharing something so wonderful forcing).

Great prices, great dishes, unique/fun atmosphere, and great service!!!

 (On one Saturday evening around 6:30 my boyfriend and I decided to pick up some Green to go, the place had a line out the door and it took about 30-45 min to get our food.  We weren't even upset about the wait, just waited patiently for our delicous order and upon arrival the server gave us two free entree tickets for our next visit and apologized.  THIS is how you keep your customers coming back for MORE!)  Love this place so much!"
5,"Who dosen't like Cosco, I love this place. The pizza is cheap and good."
5,"Nadya is one of the nicest people you will ever meet.  Part of her personality is what kept me coming back.

Recently she altered a bridesmaids dress for my girlfriend and did a terrific job.  Flawless.  In years past, she has altered all of my ""work attire.""  I have since moved, but whenever I return home, if I ever need any work done I will bring it with.

Nadya, you are a wonderful person, and any recommendation I can send your way I will!"
5,Good food
5,"Love Belly Rubz!! At first little Oscar was timid about me dropping him off but when I came to pick him up he didn't want to quit playing! He has really bad separation anxiety and hates kennels, so it is always worrisome when we try a new groomer. He loved playing and came out looking so handsome! We will be returning to Belly Rubz this week for some more play time and grooming!"
5,"This is my favorite public pool in the entire valley.  It's super cheap - 2.25 for adults, 1.00 for kids.  You can bring in drinks and snacks as long as they are not in a cooler (weird).  They have a snack bar. It's very clean.  Oh and the most important part, they have a lazy river, two big water slides, a whirlpool, toddler play area with more slides, basketball, lap pool, diving boards.... I think that's it.  It's quite a drive but it's worth it."
5,"I can't believe I haven't wrote a review for Ted's yet! By far, one of my favorite places to go. You can get full off of some tasty food for a great price. I normally get a hot dog with mayo, onion, hot sauce and a pickle. I also like the corn dog and onion rings. I can always get a satisfying and fulfilling meal for $5-7. Love it!

Can get a little crowded on the weekends, but generally all the people are pretty fast and nice."
5,"I've stayed at several hotels in the Hyatt Place chain and they are all great, but this one in particular stands out as having the friendliest, most helpful staff."
5,"I am a huge Suns fan but my review is about the fundraising options that the Suns have to offer as well as their back-office staff.

First and foremost, talk about a professional, classy organization. Whether you have fundraising experience or are a total novice, the staff treats you like you are the only group they are working with. My contact is Kyle Pottinger and he is always a gentleman. No matter what questions I have, he always answers them promptly and never makes me feel like I'm bothering him. 

The fundraising process is easy and the tickets practically sell themselves because who doesn't want the chance to purchase discounted tickets? 

The process is easy and the rewards can be lucrative depending on the target audience you are working with. The Suns will treat you professionally and courteously. You won't be disappointed."
5,"Located in the space formerly occupied by LGO's short lived Radio Milano, the north side of Campbell has been reincarnated as the Arcadia Room, a private dining facility operated by the aforementioned restaurant group.

I dined here recently for the hubby's work dinner. Unlike so many private facilites that feel like a corporate conference room, the Arcadia Room is a cool, casual, restaurant - all to your self.

We had about 60 in our group, and had plenty of room to mingle at the sleek bar lining one side of the room, or gather by the open kitchen.The weather was blazing hot when we were there, but there is even a lovely little patio outdoors for guests.

I think this would be an ideal location for any work or social occasion where you want an intimate atmosphere combined with reputable fare."
5,"The Phoenix Art Museum was a day well spent. The atmosphere was inviting and it was like around every corner was a surprise waiting to be discovered. Admission was free for me. How you may ask? Our local library has cultural passes for various museums, try checking out your library next time you go. The museum was inexpensive adventure that took me across the world. 
 All the different exhibits kept me intrigued and interested. There were paintings, drawings, photography, and sculptures galore. There were even some animated pieces. I even stumbled upon a piece you could actually walk through. The layout of the museum is very easy to follow, as they give you a map and everything is labeled. You can go from the Asian culture, to English within a matter of feet. It is mind blowing. The whole world seems so much smaller, and it's brought together so beautifully. 
 They offer guided tours, or you can walk around by yourself. There is also a children's section to the museum. I have nothing bad to say about the museum itself. I am extremely happy that I went, and would recommend that anyone go. It would be a great date, or family day, or even a day by yourself. The Phoenix Art Museum is a place that I think everyone should visit while in Phoenix. It will really open up your eyes and make you think."
5,"I LOVE BURRITO EXPRESS. My fiance has been going with his friends since they were in high school and he finally took me to try the only thing his group ever orders: a steak, potato and cheese burrito. EPIC. This burrito was so awesome that they have never tried anything else on the menu and I feel the exact same way. The tortilla is huge and fresh and the burrito itself is gigantic. I can never finish mine but the boys seem to eat it right up! Don't leave this place without trying the horchata either, it's so good. I've been to other Mexican places like this and the horchata tasted like gross water. Burrito Express however does it right and I will always go back to this place whenever I'm up for the BEST BURRITO EVER."
5,"This place is still open, but the name has been changed to Juba, and it is under new ownership. Same spot though, and the food has pretty much stayed the same besides a few changes in the menu. 

Anyway, I absolutely love coming here. My friend, Molly, is one of the servers, and I love her for introducing me to Ethiopian cuisine. It's definitely a very interesting blend of flavors, but now I come here about once or twice a week and stuff my face. I recommend trying both the vegan combo and the pita sandwich with chicken or falafel. The coffee drinks are delicious too and since they're made with Ethiopian coffee, the taste is very unique. 

If you've been hesitant about trying Ethiopian food, just get over it and go try the food at Juba. You won't be disappointed!"
5,"I absoloutely love this place.  Great Coffee, Americanos, and Lattes.  Try the Chemex if you are looking for something unique.  Very Tasty Breakfast Burritos and friendly staff.  I wish the North Location was still open, but I'll take their brews anywhere I can get them.  Skip Starbucks and hit up a real coffee shop..."
5,"Grassroots is right around the corner and we drive by it every week on our usual Friday-Dinner-Out.  I always assumed it was more of a pub than a restaurant.  My wife and I arrived around 5:00pm and were seated immediately.  The waiter was super attentive and knew the menu and preparation of everything I asked about.  

We started with an AMAZING appetizer special of burrata* with ciabatta tips, their house spicy tomato jam and arugula with champagne vinaigrette.  It was described as a sort of an experimental combination of preparations from other dishes.  The burrata was silky smooth and spreads onto the ciabatta like softened cream cheese.  The play of flavors in this dish was excellent, we'd go back here just for this dish alone.

My wife ordered the lobster bisque as her entree, which was smooth and creamy with a good lobster flavor.  I suspect we could have asked for bread on the side, but it didn't come with it by default.

I ordered the short ribs with roasted asparagus and jalapeno cheddar grits.  The ribs were cooked just right, just a little pink and tender with a concentrated glaze of delicious sauce layered on top.  The sauce had a light smoky flavor with a fair amount of saltiness, and appeared to be a long simmered reduction with bold flavor. As others have mentioned, the jalapeno grits are very good, not spicy by any means but a little crunch from the jalapeno pieces, creamy and well prepared.  I strongly recommend the short ribs to anyone.

We splurged with dessert of key lime pie and a banana split.  The split included three large scoops of (what appeared to be) homemade ice cream and topped with caramelized pecans.  The key lime was tart and delicious.

The portion sizes were perfect and considering the careful preparation and unique flavors the price was appropriate.  It's a little more expensive that I would like to put Grassroots into our weekly rotation, but I look forward to visiting it again and sample more items off the menu when the budget allows.

* I didn't know what burrata was: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrata"
5,"Best and most helpful hardware store I have visited. Thank God I live almost across the street!

After many, many home projects and recently rebuilding my kitchen, I have frequented this Ace almost more times than I should. But I am always pleased at how quickly and smoothly my searches at this Ace are.

Try it, you'll like it!"
5,"Scottsdale Fashion Square is the king of shopping centers in Arizona. It's unrivaled and it maintains it's crown through constant improvements, expansions, and new stores. Empty stores are rare. Try that on for size, PV mall. 


The food court is decent, but a wide variety of restaurants surround the mall, providing the shopper with an endless amount of stores, and a great selection of places to eat. Scottsdale Fashion Square aims to please the most critical, and goes above and beyond all expectations."
5,"The pupusas, yes, the pupusas are great. The loroco with cheese has become our favorite, But this past week, I strayed from our standard and tried the gallina soup with braised chicken and salad. All I can say is, ""What the hell? Where has this been my whole life?"" The soup is magical. Huge chunks of carrot, potato, and zucchini, with some thin noodles, and a savory broth with some mint leaves. I quickly abandoned the rest of my entree in favor of finishing the huge bowl of magic. It was the best soup I've had since coming to Phoenix 13 years ago. 

Good thing Hubby got sick this weekend- it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more. Being magical, you know it has serious healing properties. Here's where I learned that the Sopa de Gallina is chicken soup without the chicken meat and the Sopa de Pollo is the same thing but with the meat. Two huge Styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $6.00. I was stunned. The owner said it costs more with meat. Believe me, you won't miss it. Who knew that magic was so cheap? Hubby's fever is already down and he's feeling much better."
5,"I recommend this to everyone.  I have never had a bad meal here.  Inexpensive, great service, off the beaten path. Love this place."
5,"I love Fuddruckers because I can put my own toppings on including gooey, melty fake cheese!  Also, they have frings (a combo of fries and onion rings).  Very tasty."
5,"What a wonderful restaurant. I can't believe each dish is 475 calories or less and the portions are still a good size. No sauces, no bread, no fries. The fish tacos were delicious, succulent, with just the right amount of spiciness. The grilled, boneless rainbow trout was fantastic. The pane seared, sushi-grade Ahi Tuna salad was to die for. And leave room for dessert....yes dessert. Only $2.50 but arrives in a shot glass size bowl. just enough to stave off the sugar craving.
The decor is elegant and sophisticated. Great for an executive power lunch or a date to impress. menu changes 4 times a year and features local, fresh, in 'season' food. Very inventive menu starting mainly around $9 (flatbreads and sandwiches) to $16 for lunch. Wait staff is knowledgeable and attentive.
Great food, great atmosphere, great for your waist line. But even if you're not a calorie counter this still ranks right up there for the food quality, taste and presentation."
5,"AAAAMAZING.
They have the best hot dogs and corn dogs i have ever had.  It is definitely a place to try if you love hot dogs.
They have good fries, excellent onion rings.... and very very reasonable prices!  I have never met a single person who has said anything but incredible things about Ted's..... definitely a must try!"
5,I went here for my birthday this year. The best part was my friends picked up the tab:) The food was fantastic. When I found out from a friend who works here that the same chef who created the city hall menu is the executive chef at ocean club I knew getting a steak to compliment my fish was the right choice. The only down side was that everyone who went out that night were so full that we decided that it was a better idea to go home ad sleep than hit the clubs.....well maybe that wasn't a bad thing after all.
5,"My daughter and I got a recommendation from our nail tech at Scottsdale nails. WE LOVE VIETNAMESE FOOD and I was so glad to find this place. It is as good as what I used to get in Oakland, CA. The location is a little strange but once you are inside the interior is nice and tranquil and the service is very friendly. We enjoyed our noodle soup and spring rolls and we will be back for more!"
5,"Creative Healing Solutions is a fantastic naturopathic doctors office.      I'm so grateful that I found this place and met Dr. Roxie Strand and her wonderful assistant, Melissa.  My life has changed so much for the better since April 2012 when I walked into her office super frustrated with many previously unsuccessful weight loss attempts.   Dr. Roxie was attentive and thorough, and suggested I consider HCG.   I had never heard of it before then, so I went home and did my research.  I was a little nervous, but never felt any pressure and when I decided to give it a try, I felt very at ease being under her supervision.  Now, I'm 85 lbs lighter and feel better than I have in years.   I could go on and on and speak to how wonderful the program, office and Dr. Strand are, but I simply suggest that you consider visiting Dr. Roxie yourself if you are seeking to address medical issues that you haven't been able to solve before.  She does a free consultation and is genuinely interested in helping find a holistic health solution for you.   I never thought I could totally change my lifestyle, but Dr. Roxie definitely helped me find a way to do it and has been a major supporter in my journey, which I appreciate so much!    Whether you are in need of a weight loss solution or need someone to help with other medical matters, I fully recommend Dr. Strand."
5,"Finally a raw food cafe that isn't in Tempe.  Love their drinks and raw food menu.  Just wish their prices would come down bit.    

This is the type of place I could eat at everyday.  I know it is good because the afternoon lull doesn't happen to me when I eat here.    

I do NOT go daily, due to pricing, but I would like too, because I would simply live longer eating here.  Your body buzzes with clean energy (non-caffeine) after eating here.  

If you are a person who wants to be nice to your body.  Splurge and give your body what it craves....Enzymes.    

Who knew raw food was the answer to avoiding afternoon coffee.......?"
5,"Beautiful hotel, great pool, nice restaurants, fantastic service, fabulous place to stay."
5,Enjoyed date night here with the hubby. Try the gluten free pizza. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Mmmmmmm
5,"The name says it all. This is one hot bagel shop! This could be one of the best bagel shops I've found in Phoenix and I would have never expected to find it way up in North Scottsdale. This bagel shop is delicious. The bagels are large, hot, soft and extremely delicious. This local eatery has a line out the door on weekends and it's for a reason. The breakfast bagel sandwiches are to-die-for. The cheese, egg and bacon combo sandwiched between a hefty bagel makes it worth waking up early on a Sunday morning! I will be visiting again soon for the deli because I hear that it's a must to stop by and experience their lunch."
5,"Everything here is awesome! I love the Kung Pao shrimp and the Hong Kong soup which has wontons and and egg noodles they make in house. The soup they bring out before your meal is delicious as well. Everything tastes made to order, always fresh never greasy, and is presented beautifully. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Definitely try this place! It's a regular lunch spot for my office. They also have great lunch specials. :)"
5,"Superb gelato - some of the best I've ever had! The guy behind the counter is the owner, and he takes pride in his gelato.

They only use real sugar, not high fructose corn syrup, and nothing contains hydrogenated oil.

I tasted a few flavors and settled on the coconut... it was sublime. 

Definitely some of the best Gelato I have ever had. When I need a mid day sugar rush... I'll be back!"
5,Best chocolate croissants EVER!!!!
5,"Great little restaurant.  The staff is super friendly, and their happy hour specials are pretty amazing.  I got thePanko crusted Tipalia which was a little dry, but my girlfriend's stuffed mahi mahi was delicious.  The Horchata bread pudding was really good too.  They have a nice patio where most of the customers sit, I will be bringing my dog with me next time.  

It is a bit expensive, so be prepared to drop some money, but it's definitely worth checking out."
5,"OK ok ok.  I'll have to agree with some of the below reviewers that this place isn't dead-on authentic Mexican food.  That being said, I love it!  The place is huge, sporting a bakery (said many times before) with unbelievably dirt cheap pastries (not said as many times before), a little carniceria (not as good as Carniceria Sonora) and a huge dining area.  

The dining area with all its painted mural glory is so goddamn cool that I find myself wanting to just hang out there for hours watching La Primera Division de Mexico on TV and enjoying a nice $2 Dos Equis.  

The food - that's probably the only tougher part.  Keep in mind it's still pretty good, but there are better places in the area for getting your Mexican on food wise.  The potato taco is worth getting because it's fairly unique, but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork.  I grabbed a couple of the Yelp-Advertised taquitos as well - keep in mind these are not the Circle K, rolling taquitos.  They are literally just smaller tacos, but they were damn good.

I guess when it comes down to it, I'm an atmosphere buff.  There were so many cool things to check out in this multi-plex, and the atmosphere was so warm that I'd love to head back again soon."
5,"I absolutely love the food here!  The sushi and Walnut Shrimp are cravings that I must give in to.  This is a nice, small restaurant that is exceptionally clean and comfortable. Good for a casual date, lunch any day (their specials are a great deal), and the owner managers are on site most hours they are open. 
You have to try the Walnut Shrimp!"
5,"The Roaring Fork is one of my very favorite restaurants.  I am not a big fan of the environment, particularly the patio and back rooms, but the food more than makes up for it.  The pork green chili served with warm tortillas is dreamy.  I also adore the huckleberry margaritas.  Can't go wrong."
5,"By now you've heard the adventures at the Rustler's Roost ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/rustlers-rooste-phoenix#hrid:_gYib8eA4hDfylSs17Zc_g ). But my adventures in Phoenix didn't end there. 

My BGF had been hounding me for days to find some great ""Q."" He was convinced that AZ would have great ""Q"" on every corner. Now referring back to the link above, I admit that I had a wee hangover at the time. Anyway, I'll press on. We chose this place because BGF thought that this would be the spot. 

I ordered the roast garlic chicken and realized with my first bite that I had died (most likely alcohol poisoning from the night before) and was now in heaven. This was the best freakin chicken that I ever tasted. Of course I'm in heaven and BGF is grousing about the ""Q"" not being any good. 

Now I've listened to this all week from him. 

- This Q is too Spicy 
- This Q is too wet 
- This Q won't fall off the bone 
- This Q doesn't have the right flavor. 

I'll admit it, I snapped. (And I didn't forgive him for about 2 weeks). I went up one side and down the other. If you don't like the gosh darn (loosely translated) Q in AZ, the quit ordering the Blankity Blank (translation again) stuff. Needless to say, I got quite the look from BGF and boss. Boss was actually laughing at us. 

Anyway, I took pity on my BGF and shared some of my chicken, and he fell in love (I don't know why, it wasn't a rooster - oops, I digress). Anyway, it was decided then and there, this is the best chicken around, hands down."
5,Love love love this place.  Great appetizers and cocktail menu.  Must visit in Old Town Scottsadale
5,"TJ was there for me when my water heater broke and started flooding my garage.  He walked me through fixing it over the phone until he was able to send some help to my house.  Very grateful, and I will continue referring!"
5,"How can you go wrong with tortillas and pastries in one location?  I honestly don't understand how this little Mexican bakery stays in business  given everything is practically free. My hubby and I bought two empanadas for me (like a little pie or turnover), flan for him, a dozen tortillas, and 2 red burritos.  I guess you need to get there early because they were out of red tamales at 2 pm on a Friday.  

The empanadas were baked just to golden brown and the crust was so flaky and delicious words cannot describe it.  I had lemon and cherry, but I wanted to try one of everything.  The red chili in the burritos was mild but very flavorful.  Luckily they are wrapped in foil because I couldn't wait to get home to devour mine.  They could double their prices and I would still come back!

I forgot to mention the bakery is spotless, so clean I would eat off the floor if I had to."
5,"This is place IS Beer Heaven!  Over 100+ taps of amazing beers! This is the ONLY place I will purchase [several] beers at full price, not on happy hour. 
Amazing thing #2 ~ (for the girls) they have a ""shorty"" glass which is a 9oz glass instead of 12oz, it is a beautiful thing! Now I can order two different kinds of beer without getting overly full (er bloated), instead of the two big 12oz glasses! 
Amazing thing #3 ~ The food is delish!!! My boyfriend and I split a burger. Bad idea. It was so good we really didnt want to share it afterall ;)
Amazing thing #4 ~ The staff are awesome! There are several staff behind the bar and ALL are happy and willing to help you if your initial server is MIA. They are very attentive, friendly and helpful if you can't decide :) 
Amazing thing #5 ~ The atmosphere is awesome and the music they play is great!"
5,"My wife and i just dined at this restaurant. I am a chef and must say that Chef Chris's concept is one I have not experienced.The food was outstanding, service excellent and the decore was creative,down to the flower pot wine bucket and old wooden crate that it sat on.  Our entrees were served on either a bed of sundried ploenta or baby spincach and blackrice.  What really intrigued me was the slaw made of shredded green papaya that was part of the appetizer course. Being a chef I had to share a neat appetizer, that i recently found, using a baby corn shoot!  Chef keep up the suberb Cafe Monarch Bravo."
5,"I love this place. The food is clearly made with love and the folks there are so inviting and warm.  Great vibe. Great food. Great price. You can bet the next time I visit Phoenix, I'll be coming back to Tiny's ;)"
5,"I am totally addicted to this place. Tons of flavors of smoothies, and perfectly cooked Boba. Green Tea, or even Vanilla Chi - so far all the flavors I've tried have been fantastic."
5,"I came in for a gift for my boyfriend's pleasure.  The lady working there answered my questions thoroughly and professionally.  Any shyness or awkwardness I might have felt disappeared.  I was prepared to spend more for a different product but was steered to a better choice by this lady.  Turns out, my boyfriend was very happy with his gift.  This was around Halloween so there were a lot more items than usual like costumes, pasties... fun things.  I can wholeheartedly recommend this Fascinations!"
5,"Had a fabulous time here with my husband celebrating my birthday last weekend. We both got ""The Farmer's Feast"" and it was truly amazing. I was not expecting that we would each get unique dishes so that let us sample even more of the food (though the hubby didn't really share too much). I highly recommend this option for anyone dining here. 

The antipasti was a great selection of cured meats and local cheeses. Next, I had a wonderful salad that was a great combination of sharp peppery flavors mixed with sweet. Strawberries, arugula, radishes, yum! For pasta course I got gnocchi with a rich and tasty cream sauce and my husband got ravioli stuffed with yam. His dish was amazing, I had to fight for a couple bites. For the fish course I had poached halibut that was served with some kind of really flavorful sauce and a vegetable puree so that whole thing was extremely delicious. The hubby got a very lightly seared tuna fillet. I was very surprised that he enjoyed it so much since he is usually not a raw fish kind of guy. For our main course I got a pork tenderloin and the hubby got braised beef... just lucky we each got our favorite meats. Each came with other vegetables and starches on the plate so they would have been an ample meal in and of themselves. For dessert, I got a goat cheese cheesecake that was truly amazing. One of the best deserts I have ever eaten. Very rich but the pieces were small enough so that it was not heavy. The dessert did not have too much sweetness so it went well with the ice wine it was served with which tasted like pure honey. Just fantastic. The hubby got bread pudding which we didn't much care for and it came with a sorbet that I didn't try. I got the wine pairings with the meal and every wine just complimented the dish it was served with so beautifully that I was really glad I added that option. Also, it ended up that you got a half glass (at least) with each course so I think it is a good value (the wine pairing was an extra $45.) 

I do agree with a couple of the reviewers who mentioned salt. There were a couple of dishes that had just a tad too much. However, I think that was not due to a mistake of the chef, I believe it is just because they use cured meats in a lot of their dishes. Another reviewer mentioned bad service but we did not experience that at all. Our server was extremely warm and friendly. She was very knowledgeable on the food and could answer any questions we had for her. She also took the time for each course to explain each dish and in my case the wine and why they went together. Only one time did my wine not come out at the same time with the food course and in that case our server apologized immediately. I do agree with some of the reviewers that the service is very slow... however, I believe that this is intentional. They have created a very cozy and comfortable environment and they want you to linger and enjoy yourself. With the Farmer's Feast in particular it took us almost 3 hours start to finish but I enjoyed every minute of it. It was nice to have time in between courses to sit and talk and relax. The spacing also kept us from feeling too full by the end (it is six courses after all!) or from letting the flavors from one dish influence the next. I was able to enjoy each course separately and independently with its own unique wine. It was pure food heaven. This is not the type of place where you would stop in for a meal before a show or event; when you come here, this should be your only destination for the night and it is such a great experience that it will be enough!  We truly had fantastic night here.

One warning I will say is for ladies, you need to be prepared for the rural atmosphere and the walk from the car to the restaurant would be challenging in heels (I had been warned so had wedges). In fact the dress code overall was a bit more casual than I was expecting. Kai at Wildhorse Pass resort is my absolute favorite ""special occasion"" restaurant and so we were making a lot of comparisons between the two. My husband made the comment that when we were at Kai we spoke in library whispers the whole time and felt a little awkward at times (you know the type of place where you feel like if you use the wrong fork you may end up getting kicked out) but at Quiessence we were chatting away the whole time and completely at ease. It is definitely a much more comfortable and relaxed environment then any other I have experienced at a restaurant of this caliber."
5,"Love.  It.  Awesome pulled pork, brisket, turkey.  The sides are really good, too.  I feel like it's somewhat expensive, but it's worth every bite, but then again, that's BBQ.  If it's dirt cheap, that means it's not quality meat.

Anyway, the 2-pound potato is great, too -- chives, sour cream, butter...."
5,"I love this place. The Las Vegas roll is amazing however the crispy California roll isn't that crispy. Their sake is in fact bomb and the restaurant it always a good time. Their prices are reasonable for sushi places in Tempe and the service has always been awesome. If you've got a party bigger than 4 though, call ahead."
5,"I've been going to Lake Pleasant Dentistry for 2-3 years now and Dr. Sharon Bader is hands-down the best dentist I've ever had.  I've traditionally had bad experiences with dentists and am always wary of any dental procedure, but I've never felt more comfortable than with Dr. Bader.

She is very accommodating, puts you at ease, explains all the options and does GREAT work and will stand behind it.  She did a pretty complex crown for me when the tooth was borderline whether it could be saved and it worked out great.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this practice to anyone."
5,"Imagine a white silk wedding dress.... black! Well, that may be a bit dramatic but it was pretty bad. More than 1.5 years after my wedding I took my dress in to Bell. They kept my dress for a couple weeks, called me when it was ready and I was so excited to see it almost new. They did a fantastic job and were careful not to over treat the lace and silk with chemicals. They made me feel like they really cared. 

The business is family owned and the man at the front is so nice to work with. And, the pricing was extremely fair. I paid $89 which was much more reasonable than other places I checked. 

I highly recommend Bell Cleaners."
5,"Hospitality Suite Resort was my home away from home this last week and although they are not a posh spa type resort, they were filled with heart and gave me everything I needed in the seven nights I spent there.

Why did I chose Hospitality Suite Resort?  I needed a place for seven nights (eight days) while I worked on my qualifying exams and worked on my dissertation in Phoenix.  I had two basic needs, a place that was cheap and had free internet.  That they had a daily breakfast was a plus, as was laundry facilities.  They had the best price for all these options, so I jumped.

After a flight to Sky Harbor, getting a rental car, driving to Scottsdale, I had a hard time finding the hotel.  I finally asked another hotel on Scottsdale Ave. and she said, ""OH yeah, the numbers are funny that way!""  Ha!  Very funny.  After that first time, I didn't have any trouble finding my way back to it again.  My morning commute to the Hokokum campus was very straightforward.  I was pretty much set.

I was greeted by a fellow named J.J. who talked very fast (or maybe because of my travel and the time, I was processing very slowly).  He gave me a room on the third floor that was ""overlooking the pool"" (P.S. all rooms are ""overlooking the pool"").  He told the best place to park and showed me on the map where the elevator was.  It did take me awhile to find the elevator with my stuff in my hands, but eventually I did.  There were some British/French kiddos hanging out in the poor area, whooping it up and there was music coming from the lounge, but it didn't matter, I was so tired, I could have fallen asleep in a airplane (oh, wait, I did that too!).

The next morning, I took in more of my surroundings.  My room had a lovely little kitchen with all the necessities and a nice large bathroom with a small stall shower.  The was a lovely full-sized ironing board and steam iron.  There was a coffee maker in the kitchen, along with a toaster, microwave, fridge (small) and hotplate.  There was a nice reading lamp over the bed and an easy-to-use clock radio.  There was a desk as well as a table and three chairs.  The king size bed was comfortable, but not overly so.  I certainly had no trouble sleeping while there, but I didn't have a trouble getting out of bed either.  Perfect.

Breakfast was a choice of five breakfasts.  The menus were laminated, meaning the that choices did not change, but that was ok.  I chose two eggs, sausage, hash browns, whole wheat toast, oj and coffee every morning.  By the second day, I was greeted by name.  That was a nice touch, because I felt that I was very very far away from home.

Instead of eating out every night, I went to Food City, just down the road and bought supplies to heat up in the micro. I bought sodas for the fridge and micro popcorn.  Ahhhhh... all the comforts of home.  Because I was up late working on my classwork, the partying didn't bother me.  The pool was a magnet for people, even at night, because it finally was cooling down.  I didn't go to any of the happy hours (friends don't let friend write on their dissertation drunk), but they sure looked like people were having fun!

Doing laundry was a little complex due to my own non-reading of the map.  I made this huge circuitous route because I didn't know there was a laundry room in the part of the hotel I was staying.  Next time I will know!!

All in all, I enjoyed my stay at Hospitality Suite Resort.  Next time I would bring less clothes because of the superb laundry facilities (you don't need to bring quarters because you buy tokens at the lobby).  Next time I would remember to bring a swim suit because those pools looked sooooo good!
Yep, next time I would stay at Hospitality Suite Resort, it's got it all."
5,"I really enjoy this place. It's beautifully designed. It's hidden in a historic neighborhood, (zoning issues so no patio), and they make they own tonic! ---What else does one need? 

But now the food. Rich, full flavored, comfort food. I don't think there is a cuisine style here as far as I could tell, just some of the best food around. 

Had the fontina crusted with pinko and walnuts, awesome. A potato side dish, damn good I tell you. For the main course the skirt steak, which was some of the best red meat I'm had in a very, very long time. 

This is my vote for best new restaurant in Phoenix. Seriously."
5,"NOTE:  I only had take-out, and it was brought to me by my boss.  She rules!
She got me a hummus/grilled/marinated chicken combo.  It has 3 different hummus...es...es (HA!): roasted red pepper, jalapeno and plain ole' hummus.  They are sectioned off in the big plastic container, which rules for my OCD, as I don't like my food touching.  In the center is a PILE (a total monton!) of grilled chicken.  It's got some sort or spicy rub on it, but not too much kick.  It had been marinated, too.  And tender....I think this is the most tender chicken I have ever had.  It made my own tender spots as juicy as the chicken was!
I'm not big on pita, so instead she got me a side of cukes.  
This thing weighs a ton and I've been eating it for 2 hours.  I have made a mess in my ""Make me Yelp"" boyshorts."
5,"Perfect burritos, polite staff with a couple cuties working here.  I love Chipotle!"
5,Love it here!  Always unique and slightly dark art.  Definitely a go see if you are in phoenix~
5,"Delicious, clean, great service! 3 hours later and we are still talking about how delightful this place was. We had the pulled pork and chicken sandwich - both were moist and fresh. Dinner for 2 for 20.00!"
5,"Wow this place is great. The whole atmosphere is unique. Bowling, bars, dj - it's an awesome idea. Only thing is on a Friday, it's super busy and takes along time to get a bowling lane."
5,"I have been meaning to stop in but keep driving on by.  I am SO GLAD that I stopped. I was pleased the moment I walked in.  The store is well lit and cheery, the books line the wall making you feel like you're walking into a oasis of knowledge.  I found 10 copies of the book I was looking for (I needed 10 copies) and the owner said he will order me copies of two books he didn't have.  Also, he offered his community room for my book club!  So nice, very friendly, definitely the kind of place we want to encourage."
5,"If you're willing to run out for lunch a little early, enjoy the lively patio atmosphere will dining on yummy vittles.
A When-Harry-Met-Sally picky eater, I, um, grilled the waiter on seafood's sustainability and ingredient origin, and he was good-natured and knowledgeable.
A perfect eatery for a casual date or girls' day out. 
Yay!"
5,"I'm glad I bought my tickets back in August when the event was first posted.  I'm not sure the organizers knew what an amazing turn out they would have but the event was sold out so tickets were not available at the door.  We arrived at 11:15 (doors opened at 11) and while standing in line to get in there was a staff person checking to make sure we all had tickets and letting people know that if they did not, the event was sold out. 

Once inside it was a sea of cupcakes!  Tiny cupcakes that were delicious!  I didn't taste one that I didn't like.  Liberty Market was my fave I think.  Espresso Carmel and Red Velvet!  YUM!!!  Cruelty Free Cakes makes delicious vegan cupcakes too!  I also liked the ones from Cry Baby Ranch. I'm going to have to find them again at the 20th street Farmers Market and Old Town Scottsdale Farmers Market.  And everyone was so nice!  

$10 got you all the cupcakes you could eat and water AND milk!!  And it was for two very worthy causes.  Singleton Moms and Safe Haven For Animals.  There were also raffles, a cupcake eating contest and cupcake decorating for the kids.  So many festivals these days charge you to get in and then, once inside, charge for everything else.  People can't afford that these days so it was refreshing to go to an event and not be nickel and dimed for everything.  I appreciate that.  And best of all my daughter had a great time!  There were lots of people so it was a little overwhelming for her but she loved it.  Both of us are just coming down from our sugar high.  

It was great to see Gabi and Lindsey manning the Yelp booth and our very own Thomas S. helping with emcee duties!  

Will I be back next year?  You bet!!  And you should come too....just make sure you get your tickets early!"
5,"Really good food, fun atmosphere, great experience and totally unique and fun. 
I would way rather spend my money at a one of a kind, family owned shop than a cheaper- dime a dozen corporate mcdonalds."
5,"I'm not gonna lie, I possibly had the best sunny side up eggs ever. 
A simple dish so rarely cooked perfectly."
5,"This place is a bit difficult to find granted but well worth the effort. If you're shopping down at the farmer's market, need a place to study, or just want to plop down with a good book, Fair Trade will caffeinate you as well as  feed you such tasties as quiches, stuffed croissants, cookies, bagels, and sandwiches.  

The cafe was run by the church up until Julyish in answer to Mr. K's musing but they've been bought by a few of the regular customers and are enjoying a slow but steady revitalization along with a steady extension of hours.  They're also hopefully expanding they're menus to include more food food items as volume picks up. 

Additionally, they offer only fair trade coffee and teas so you can do your part to help fair trade just by sipping at a cup of coffee."
5,"I'm pretty sure that Palee's Crown is the best Thai place I have ever been to. The service is always great, and the Owner comes out to talk to us whenever we are there.
The food is so amazing, I have never tried something that I disliked at all. I especially love the Pad Thai and the Currys. I am always full and completely satisfied by the time I leave. I also recommend trying the Thai Iced Tea to drink if you are like me and enjoy weird authentic drinks, and for dessert be sure to get the coconut ice cream. Don't make excuses about trying to spend less money or that you are being careful about what you're eating, just try it.
The prices are good and if you're not sure what to try, stick with a curry but remember that Asian spices are very distinct, and very spicy."
5,"Talk about an amazing experience...First off the office is well decorated and clean...the staff pleasant and helpful...Rene the hygenist is caring and gentle.  Dr. Keith is really personable and excellent at what he does.  They don't do extra work that doesn't need to be done, they are very honest.  The office takes many kinds of insurance and they are great with kids too!"
5,"The boyfriend and I like to do little staycations every now and then so when we saw a deal advertised for the Camelback Inn we jumped on it. We stayed two nights in just a regular room, I guess. They had several different kinds of suites (even rooms with a private pool!) but our room was a standard room with a nice patio facing Camelback Mountain. The room was spacious and clean, the bed was comfy and the patio was the perfect place to enjoy breakfast.

Camelback Inn was much bigger than I expected. Lots and lots of buildings spread out over the property. It's not the easiest place to find your way around but at least it's pretty to look at while you get lost. At the back of the property is a little ghost town set up. It looks like they do corporate events - cowboy cookouts - but nothing was going on while we were there. But we had fun wandering around the ""town"" and taking goofy pictures of each other.

Even though it was December it was warm enough to hang out by the pool. The pool is heated so that helped and there are two hot tubs as well for really chilly days. They have an abundance of lounge chairs and even offer float rafts and fun noodles for the pool. There were kids splashing around but the area is big enough you can hide away from the action if you prefer.

We ate at two of the restaurants while we were there - BLT Steak and Rita's Kitchen and both were fantastic. 

We loved our Camelback Inn staycation and would not hesitate to go back - especially in the summer when the rates are low!"
5,"5 ENTHUSIASTIC STARS

This is a large, well maintained botanical garden, teeming with birdlife and abundant in blooming cacti, succulents & other flowers.

Even though it can be HOT, it is very easy to spend half a day here, as we did, wandering the trails. If you need a break, there is a patio cafe where you can get a cool one.

This place is a true delight and a great asset for Phoenix."
5,Yummy!
5,"Put it in the baby book.  Baby's first AJ's.  And you'll always have a special soft place in your heart for your first.  

I love that while this location is in a nice part of town, it's not quite the same level of frou-frou as many other spots.  That means rather than dealing with the Scottsdale types who have to dress up to go to the store - you're dealing with a greater range of folks - but they are all willing to pay a bit more for the good stuff.  I will say, you'll pay less for a box of cereal or box of triscuits at a Circle K than you will at an AJ's. And I don't think I've ever seen anything on sale.  

But there is just nothing like their fresh food.  Be it produce or the meat section, the colors are brighter, the items are bigger and you just know it's going to taste better.  Their chicken breasts and pork chops are so amazingly good, and so large, you want to eat them all at once, but you just can't.  You have to try some of their pre-prepped meats.  My fav is a pork loin with apple stuffing.  Wow. 

And of course, great pre-made foods too if you just want to pick up something to go.  I've been suckered in to their desert section far too many times.  And they are always good.  But dang they can be pricy - so it really has to just be a special splurge.  

If you haven't tried an AJ's yet, I suggest this one to ease you into things.   There may be quite a few Lexus in the parking lot, but there won't be too many Hummers."
5,"NOTE: Ignore the reviews above. It looks as if there is some deliberate attempt by the Udupai owners to pose as members and bash this place. Yes, this owner used to own Udupai Cafe and Udupai Cafe is another dosa house that competes with this eatery.  If you read my other reviews, you know that I'm critical and  my attention to detail is there so I'm not one of these people who likes every place he eats at.

Positives
I'm Indian and I can assure you this place is good. I have never been to Udupai Cafe but based on its failing health inspections, I would be scared to eat there. Woodlands is a nice CLEAN eatery in a nice part of Chandler.  It's not a restaurant.  It's basically a Dosa shop. They  specialize in Dosa and offer several types. They also have excellent Indian Chinese dishes.   The food is consistently good and I have eaten there on several occassions.  This is a lunch/light dinner place.  Don't think of this place like a restaurant.  There are several types of Dosa and that's what this place specializes in.  The restaurant is also modern and not is some ghetto strip mall so don't worry about failing health codes here...at least not for a while.

Negatives
Their non-South Indian dishes are not so good. For non-Indians, they should be informed that this is a Dosa house so order dosa and other south Indian dishes.  Don't order your typical Indian restaurant favorites like palak paneer (it wasn't good here).   The owner also says every dish is excellent which isn't true; he is kind of a businessman so he doesn't really care about telling you which dishes stand out.  Stick to the Dosa and the Vegetable Manchurian.  Their mango shake wasn't very good. Their chiku shake is great."
5,"I Love this place. I eat here either take in or take out at least 2 times a week!

I also agree with some of the others. I love the fact that I can try something new without committing! I love the revolving sushi. I also do not like that there are a lot of spicy selections. Why not offer the spice on the side. I would love some of the sushi, but it has that spicy sauce on it.

Some of the best to offer that some people might not know about:

Haru sushi - Tuna stuffed with crab and topped with avocado!
Hand rolls - YUM!!! Some are only 2.50
Udon - Good!

The staff is great. The wait can be long on some days or eves.

Love the baked scallops. Great mussels too."
5,"Tanzy, Yelp, and Lindsey deserve the biggest standing O for this event.  

I honestly think I am still full from the generous food options that kept flowing.  I kept thinking we were done, but OH NO here comes another course.  I felt like I was at a chef tasting menu dinner.  

Right when we got there we had a glass of Champagne and were seated with a olive and meat plate followed by some bruschetta and local made cheese.  After the event officially started we were hit with amazing course after amazing course.  With never empty glasses of wine  

My Favs:

Sweet Corn Risotto

Scallops (cooked to perfection with a parsnip puree mmmmmmmm)

Alaskan King Salmon

Center Cut Filet Mignon

Brussel Sprouts yes Brussel Sprouts (Tempura battered with a sweet relish AMAZING)

4 hour braised beef short rib (Talk about melt in your mouth)  

Red Velvet Bread Pudding (I will go back just for this anytime I am near the Quarter)

I can't wait to go back to Tanzy for a full meal but I don't know how I will be able to top this evening of amazing food.  

I was very surprised to hear they have been open for 2 years as I was really blown away with their food and service.  

Thanks again to everyone who helped put together this amazing event what a great way to end 2012."
5,"Kindred Spirits has closed their doors. It is a sad thing that we on the west side of Phoenix cannot support such a friendly and community oriented business, AND one that gave you the option to drop by for a quick coffee or for a more complete dining experience. The live music on the weekends was also something a bit rare for our side of town, and will be missed. Richard and Debra did a marvelous job updating the space, and making it a warm and welcoming place. I am sorry that Youngtown has lost this business."
5,"Love the food here.  Been here a few times and got the peanut curry twice and been delish.  Thai iced tea was great as well.  Only been there during lunch and everything seems pretty good so far.  Went with coworkers and family and they all loved it too.  Service was fast, prompt and nice.  Will be back again to try other dishes."
5,"A friend of a friend was telling us about this place on Sunday morning, and how awesome their pizza is.  It sounded awesome, but he warned us the line is usually an hour and a half long.  Oh well, we went anyway.  Luckily, we were early enough where we didn't have to wait long for a table.  When we were leaving, though, the line was easily an hour long.

We started with the wings, which come in an order of 14 and were delicious.  Five of us were dining there, so we ordered two small pizzas, with each one being a half, so we had a nice variety of pizzas to try from.  We got the BBQ Chicken, the Frisco, Grandma G's, and one more that eludes me now.  All were pretty delicious, and I give them mad props for going out of their way to create unique pizzas with untraditional toppings (Grandma G's had potato on it).  Our entire bill with a few drinks came to under $80.

Oh, make sure you sit outside... the inside had a lot of loud kids, and it seemed to echo off each wall and annoy the hell out of our party.  The women in our party also said the air temperature kept changing in there.  Keep in mind, too, that they don't have a full bar, so if you're going there hoping to start off with a bloody mary, you're out of luck."
5,"This place had amazing food for reasonable prices. They have tiny card games at the tables which was pretty neat too, it keeps you busy while you wait for your food. The bar was neat, and the atmosphere was ok. I did not enjoy the music, and it was too loud to ignore. The service was pretty good, but the waitress made my friends and I uncomfortable, like we shouldn't have been there. It might have just been that one particular girl, and I would still go back. Don't dress too casual..."
5,"Bruce saved my day, my computer crashed this morning and I gave him a call and he was able to come out same day.  He went through my whole system at my office and even updated my anti-virus with a free AVG instead of paying for that crappy Norton service.  He was able to go through and recover all my files and found out the operating system was corrupted.  He saved my day and completed everything same day.  Thank you Bruce!"
5,"Restaurant 28 is a solid hole-in-the-wall that's pretty easy to miss, but it's definitely worth a stop.  On my visits I've gotten brisket and other barbecue, and my friends swear by the chicken and say it's some of their favorite chicken in the Valley.  The hush puppies are great- the greens are good too.

Another review said it well when they said this place doesn't underseason food.  Every time I've gone it hasn't been bland- it's got some great flavor and it's tasty stuff.

It's in a pretty dull area where there isn't much else to do, or I'd be out there more often.  It's a tiny place too but I've never been in and had it be hugely busy or busy to the point that waiting was crazy.

Definitely recommended, and I hope they're able to grow and thrive."
5,"I joined a friend for a two hour evening ride at CCO. We were the only two riders, may be because it was a Sunday eve and all the tourists were drinking their mimosas by their hotel pools.
The horses looked very well taken care of. Mine was 17 year old Sundance, a beautiful brown male. I've never ridden before, and he was easy to control. Our guide Ed was patient, funny and awesome company. He showed me the basics and was always there with a word of encouragement and a tip or two.
Tip for the guys, if you plan to trot, wear tight jeans, you will be thankful at the end of the day. The city slicker that I am,
I left my phone in my shirt pocket, ended up dropping it while on the ride and Ed helped us go look for it. The desert, sun set over the mountains and the sandstorm about 30 miles away all made this a very memorable evening.
I highly recommend CCO."
5,"Amazing.

This is often called the largest mall in Arizona, and it shows. Each time I've done the usual ""mall walk"" I've easily lost a few hours trying to see it all. It's true that this isn't a place for anyone that doesn't care about fashion - but this is a mall that's true to its name. ""Fashion Center"" is no joke here. Lots of high-end designer stores, lots of mid-range affordable fashion stores, and a few random familiar stops like Hallmark and Pottery Barn-esque stores scattered through there. A decent food court, with a theater also conveniently down there. (But after spending so many hours at the mall, who has time for a movie?)

You can easily drop a few thousand here, so be forewarned if you're on a budget. Also, I almost wish I had a map in my pocket, because it can get confusing to remember which hallways you've already explored. And wear some comfortable walking shoes, because it's not easy to get in and get out of this one. But there's a good number of parking to use in a garage or few - when you remember where you parked the car. 

I'd take any out-of-towner here, unless they had a grudge against fashion, classy stores, or walking."
5,"I have been visiting Mrs. White's going on 30 years, but after looking up the phone number this afternoon to verify if they were open and still had fried chicken, my wife started reading some of the reviews following a recent Food Network recommendation - I almost got cold feet.

Good thing I didn't. The food is as awesome as ever. The service is much as it has always been. Be forewarned, trendy restaurant goers, who glom onto TV reviews, Mrs. White's is not trendy; there are no bubbly fresh blonde girls waiting to seat you. The service is matter of fact, no goofing around, you must get to the business of ordering and pretend you know what you are doing - this is the way it has always been at Mrs. White's. If you are looking for others to pamper you, this is not the place for that. Mrs. White's is where you go to pamper your indulgence for perfect soul food. If you want Scottsdale ambiance, again, this joint won't work for you.

When you go, be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit. There are no corporate owned semi-trailers that deliver two tons of food every other day. This is a small and very cramped operation that makes homemade food for those who know how to appreciate it. In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants, this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen. If they run out of your favorite dish that has been cooking for hours prior to your arrival, there is no way they can whip up another pot of green beans and potatoes in 20 minutes. 

I often call ahead to verify if they have what I want because years ago it was not uncommon that by 12:30 they would be out of half of everything on the menu, which was OK because if forced me to try new things Back then, Mrs. White's was open Monday through Friday from 11:00 till 3:00, but I'd swear you'd be lucky to get anything after 1:00 - and that was perfectly fine as you knew they were doing all they could with their limited space to do their best for us customers. I'd just come back on another day. 

To say I have the utmost respect for the White family would be an understatement, today I was afraid I might have to lose that based on those poor reviews below. I do not believe those reviews are an accurate representation of The Golden Rule Cafe. They are the distortions and disappointments of people who have skewed expectations. Funky little hole-in-the-wall family-run operations that attract a loyal customer base may not be the place for everyone, but if you understand that wonderful stuff doesn't always come wrapped in a sterile designer package, then you might get along with Mrs. White's.

I love this place and hope I always will."
5,"SOOOOOOOOO MUCH FUN! The 3 of us went to Superstition Farm for their tour last Saturday. No, we didn't have any kids with us but we may have had a better time than most of the kids.

The beginning is a bit dry. You're in the ""classroom"" for a while learning about random facts related to diary cows.  Moo.  After that, it's a hay ride.  Girls, let me give you one tip - Make sure you wear long pants or shorts that are long.  Hay is very uncomfortable under your butt if there isn't enough padding.  Anyway, the hay ride was entertaining but the best part had yet to come.

Once the hayride was over, the ""tour"" was officially over.  But everyone stuck around to check out the petting zoo. The animals were all so friendly and we got to feed them as well.  There was a hodgepodge of creatures from a young cow to sheep to rabbits and even a turkey.  Yum...just kidding.

In addition, there's a black lab on the premise that was amazing.  This dog would make an incredible soccer player.  His reaction time is unbelievable - any team would be happy to have him as a goalie.

After the animal bonding, we went to try flavored milk.  Mine was butterscotch flavored and it was just ok.  I was disappointed that the milk wasn't fresh from the farm but I guess it's not legal to serve unprocessed milk.  Since we had a Groupon, we also had a chance to try Udder Delights ice cream. At $2.50 each, I would never pay for them individually. But seeing that it was included in my ""deal,"" we enjoyed them a lot.

Don't be embarrassed if you don't have kids.  Trust me, adults can enjoy Superstition Farm too."
5,Man the chompie sliders is the bomb.  Wish there were some in LA.  Man taste so good and flavor.
5,I stayed at the hotel and I tried Tuscany and it was really good.  Delicious Scallops and pasta.  Also the pizza was excellent.  The server was great and I would return to this restaurant when I visit the hotel again.
5,"Looking a cutting edge, wanting the best for everyone type of pet boutique you must go to Oliver and Annie's. 

Chris, the owner is amazing! He knows his stuff and has the best of the best. There is no pet boutique like his. Urban chic and healthy top draw. He is an amazing supporter of local artists and designers and an absolute delight to know and do business with. His loving nature is endearing! 

It's no surprise he just received the ""Best of Phoenix"" award."
5,"Great selection, TONS of flavor, always hot and fresh, nice staff, great prices. In my top 3 quick restaurants."
5,"Place is always friend, and I LOVE THE PIZZA.     It's by far my favorite pizza place.   Sign up on their VIP newsletter or eclub and you get a free pizza on your birthday, get it for free and try it.     Sounds good to me."
5,"Chopped Salad was fabulous, as was the lamb burger. Service was top rate."
5,"This is the best ice cream I've ever had, bar none!  I had the salted caramel, and it was wonderful!  I felt like I was 7 years old and enjoying my first ever ice cream cone.  I also love the decor of the shop, the braille on the back wall is so cool (although I do wonder exactly what it says!)  I also bought a pint of their ice cream at Whole Foods, I love Sweet Republic and everything it stands for!  Totally recommended!"
5,"Just a quick review to reiterate how truly great this place is.

They've got soda, lots of soda.  That's right, I said soda! They've got root beer, sarsaparilla, freaky foreign sodas, teas, waters and other things. 

I love this place, I have no complaints. The only thing that would make this place better would be the addition of beer. Man, if these guys hooked up with the dudes that run the beer section of Topps  Liquors it would be unstopable!"
5,"Delicious food, amazing martini's, and wonderful desserts. Every dish I have eaten here has been nothing short of awesome. First, to start they have house infused seasonal vodkas. You can see the vodkas steeping on the bar when you walk in. Appetizers are not overly filling - The frito misto is always seasonal so depending on the time of year you will get different things. The coating is perfect and light so you can really taste the vegetables but still get the crunch. The same is true with the mozzarella. The cheese was fresh and the crunchy crust of fried coating around it was perfect. 

As far as entrees go, the portions are perfectly sized and flavorful. The pasta is perfectly cooked and coated with whatever you choose on the menu. I love the simplicity of some and the complexity of others. Finally, desert has always been good. Try the limoncello cheesecake or any flavor of gelato and you certainly won't be disappointed."
5,Great food!!! The French dip is to die for!! Great Service! Clean and fancy especially for the area it's located in!  Def a hidden gem! My husband and I both love going here and can't wait until next time.
5,"We have been here now several times.  This Is one of the best restaurants we have ever been to.  The food and service is absolutely the best.   Most everything is cooked in their exposed kitchen.  Everything off the grill is awesome.

The servers will patiently answer all your questions and appear as though they really enjoy seeing you pleased with your experience.

Since we have been here several times here is a list of some items we have had:

For one, if you don't mind spending the money the toro ""tour"" is great.  They have something like 5 different kinds of toro.  From real fatty to a little less.  Melts in your mouth.  The presentation is very impressive.  It is served on ice with different kinds of salt and (to us) a very unique way of presenting the wasabi.

All there other sushis are served perfectly prepared

The steak is excellent.  The flavor is spectacular,  grilled in view over an open flame and quite literally cooked, always and without fail, exactly to you specification.

All tempura dishes are great

Grilled zucchini.... Very good and juicy.

Seabass with miso.  Cooked perfectly.

I suggest you order to share and sit at the counter.  It makes for a very good experience.  This is the place where you should go in without worrying about cost.  Just go for it, tske your time and experience it all.  It will make for a very good experience.

Try their very unique drinks, they are very refreshing.

Or, if you are real daring, the tasting menu is literally a 4 hour experience.  
Did it once.  It's a bit long for us and wont do it again."
5,"Bosa Donuts at Southern and Mcklintock in Tempe is part of a strip mall that I have been visiting since I was just a kid. Except, back then, Bosa Donuts was a Taco Bell. A few years back Taco Bell moved a half mile down the road into a new building and Bosa Donuts set up shop. About a year ago I discovered another new store in this strip mall which is Fallout Games, an awesome video game store. For this entire last year I've been driving past Bosa on my way out of the complex after visiting Fallout Games and taking a curious look as I drive by but until this week I had never tried it. After reading all the positive Yelp reviews, I had to give it a go.

Well, first off, It's 24 hours, which is huge in my book since I'm almost always up until four or five in the morning. The drive through display is lighted and shows their menu but you have to actually order by pulling up to the window. Since I was there at 3am I asked what was fresh at the moment and the guy was very patient and helpful with listing off what he had available. I just got a few frosted donuts (or raised, as they call them) and was on my way. Right off the bat, I noticed the box was pretty heavy. I only ordered a half dozen but it felt at least as heavy as it does when I get a dozen at Dunkin Donuts. When I got home, I opened the box and realized their donuts are at least thirty percent bigger than Dunkin Donuts of Krispy Kreme.

Anyway, the donuts are awesome. Best tasting donuts I've ever had. I probably shouldn't make it a habit to come here twice a week, if I want to live past forty, but I'll definitely be stopping by once or twice a month from now on. Hope this place sticks around."
5,"There're times when you eat something and you want more. Then there are times when you eat something and you instantly know you will never have anything quite like it. For me, I experienced both of those at Pizzeria Bianco. My buddy and I drove almost 500 miles from Santa Barbara for a Giants-Diamondbacks game and thought we'd try this place I had heard about. We arrived fairly late so there was about a one hour wait but man, was it worth it. We ordered a Biancoverde and a Wiseguy. I was a bit skeptical at first because they each didn't have tomato sauce like I was used to, but I realized I dont care much for tomato sauce in the first place and I'm always up for trying new things. BEST DECISION OF THE DAY. The Biancoverde was my favorite. It was so simple (3 cheeses, arugula, and olive oil) yet so amazing. It has left me wanting more to this day. The staff was nice and friendly, not to mention a few cuties. I will definitely drive 500 miles for it again. In fact, I'll be making my way to Phoenix in a few weeks, JUST for the pizza!"
5,"Favorite Pho in the phoenix area so far.  
Great, tender meat in my pho chin nam (#8).
I see they also have bun bo hue on the menu so I'll have to try that sometime soon.    
Nom nom.

Friendly staff.

See ya there!"
5,Love it! Closest thing in Tempe to the food we actually had in Thailand.
5,"I found some great t-shirts for friends here, including one from a local PHX artist with a grinning skull.  

If you're a hipster or looking to buy gifts for one, then this is the place to go. 

Plus, the clerk was using a Mac (not that I would expect anything different, but bonus verisimilitude points for fitting in with your surroundings Mr. Clerk)."
5,"Why would I go to a restaurant and hope for the worst?  Because I'm a snob and as a snob I was convinced that The Capital Grille would fall short of my extremely high expectations.  Not so.

Bread basket: Outstanding onion bread, a pumpernickel/golden raisin bread, and some crisp cracker bread.  Nice all around.

Extensive wines by the bottle with some great values to be had.  I did not check by the glass.  Our wine was decanted artfully at our table and the staff had a ready knowledge of the vineyard and year we had selected.

Husband had:

Oysters -  Blue point tonight, small this time of year so no big surprise there, well prepared and delicious.

Lamb chop - Perfectly flavored and cooked, Frenched, the definition of how to prepare and cook a lamb chop perfectly.

Potato Au Gratin - Typical steakhouse Au gratin.  Excellent flavor, huge portion, guaranteed to please a crowd (or anyone that loves a delicious cheesy crusted potato).

I had:

Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella - You can't imagine how good this is....a lovely thin slice of prosciutto cooked to crisp perfection wrapped around a fresh piece of mozzarella cheese, with just the right amount of melt but not escaping the prosciutto shell.  A parmesan toast and tomato salad round this out.  You might as well as shaved gold on the side.

Sliced filet - I'm not going to go into detail, just know that the answer is YES! (Is it fantastic? Is it cooked to perfection? Is the flavor wonderful? Is it a great cut?)

Asparagus with Hollendaise - Awesome stuff.  Nice to have a great hollendaise that I didn't have to prepare.

Service - Our server was so outstanding I'm going to contact the manager at this location.

Atmosphere - We had a corner table that gave us great privacy.  We could not hear our neighbors."
5,"Mid size American airport with very good organization, very straight forward, no hassle. 

Security is a little slow and priority lane isn't really priority, it's more of ""let's make fun of first class flyers getting pissed"" lane, so let's welcome first class flyers with big giggle!! 

Many stores and food quality is okay. Seating areas are limited, at least for the Terminal 3 before security, so be aware. 

Lots of volunteers working here to guide you to the right place, there may be more volunteers than passengers. Haha."
5,"We love The Olive Tree! We call it 'the grill' We eat there at least once a week - my littlest one has swim lessons right next door. Both my picky eaters love eating there! We love the chicken kabobs and the chicken shwarma(sp?). Family ran, great food we love it!"
5,"Just as good a Pizzeria Bianco! But with the added bonus of not having to wait for hours and hours. Granted there may still be a wait here but you aren't fighting tourist for tables at this joint. It's more of a local fav! 

Fresh gourmet toppings and very good crust! Personally a big fan of the garden seating! There was a longer than normal wait for the food however, the server was very attentive and I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance as we had drinks in garden. I would not recommend this place for a quick meal but it's perfect if you bring friends and want to have time to relax and enjoy conversation!"
5,"Came here with a bunch of the crew from work during lunch, and wow! This hidden gem on the corner of Indian School & 48th Street is a must visit if you're in the Arcadia area. The food here is amazing, and there's such a wide variety including delicious tater tots (even sweet potato tater tots) and the mouth watering reuben that I had chosen. You get a good sized portion as well. Thank goodness for take-home boxes! 

The restaurant is very spacious, and the staff is really friendly & laid back but get you seated and eating your food in no time. It gets better; the price of the food is VERY reasonable, in fact, I'm kind of shocked how inexpensive they are. A well deserved five stars!"
5,"Honestly the best part of this place is the unbelievable deal you can get on pet related products. Because they are one of the primary income sources for HALO Animal Rescue, people that have pets, tend to make donations. You can almost always find pet carriers for under $10. They have dog crates for training and you don't have to shell out a fortune for them. They have fish tanks that will allow you to let little Johnny get his feet wet in the world of pet care and the associated responsibilities without breaking the bank. If you are a person that shares your life with animals, you understand the rarity of these kinds of deals!

Yes they have clothes, furniture, tchatchkies, etc., but the real deals are on the pet products.

As a side note, HALO recently leased the MCCAC location at 5231 North 35th Avenue (It was the previous Maricopa County run cat adoption center). So if you are looking for a companion (cat or dog), check them out and support one of the fastest growing no-kill efforts in the US.

5,"We tried this last night for our date night.  We were impressed.  The waitress was amazing in explaining the menu and making suggestions. This is a great place to relax and talk.  The food was great.  I had the Tartiflette...WOW it was so good.  My husband had the La Potence, which is their speciality.  He thought it was great...We will be back..."
5,"Greatness in the form of food, just like the other locations. 

The service was particularly good at this location. We sat at the bar,and while the other customers were mildly annoying, the late night bartenders were up beat, witty, and very personable.

The atmosphere was par for the course.

All in all, if you are reading this review, get your directions to this location, close the browser, and go eat!"
5,"I have totally fallen in love at Tuck Shop.  Everything here is fantastic.  My friend and I come here about twice a month and enjoy some snacks and wine.  The beer battered Cheese Curds may just change your life for the better... we are seriously tempted to each get our own order. 

(I am not very good at sharing and i always get what I want!   ...No i'm not an only child... well, maybe I was until i was 11, how did you know.  WAH!)   

Oh, and Laura is fantastic.  She always takes great care of us as we enjoy a glass of wine on the couch in the reading room.  

Thursday's special is meat loaf... don't deny yourself, just indulge.  :)"
5,"I love this place! Great place to grab a quick smoothie or stay to hang out! (just let them know if you're in a  hurry)

P.S. The phone number is area code 480 not 490 :)"
5,"Every time I go into this place its with good times and cheery mates and I leave the wiser with a pint of fresh brew and some of the best food. 

To make a great date, go to the Phoenix Rock Gym first and then climb the ladder on the back wall and walk in around the back...Great times for every one!"
5,"Great selection of vitamins and supplements, good prices and I can get the special treats our cat likes while I'm picking up the goods for myself. Plus their rewards program is pretty straightforward.

I also like that they are not ""all over you"" like the other local chain is when you walk in the door. 

I highly recommend the Vitamin Shoppe on Camelback!"
5,"Eating in is a decent experience, but for delivery, I have yet to meet their match.  When I order delivery I always get a 16"" chicken pizza with alfredo sauce on top, and for the last 6 years I have received it in 30 minutes or less all but 2 times.  Its always tasty, fresh, and is my preeminent food for delivery, ever, period."
5,"Pizzeria Bianco: Before and After 
Cited as ""the best pizza in America"" in numerous on-line reviews as well as on Good Morning America and as published in, Slice of Heaven, to most pizza lovers the three to four hour wait for a table is so daunting that they push on to a more open table atmosphere for their pizza experience. But to the true pizza enthusiast, Pizzeria Bianco is as much about the experience as it is the food. This place is best known for the owner Chris Bianco, hand tossing each and every pizza pie served every Tuesday through Saturday, from 5-10 pm for nearly 15 years, of which I was one of those fortunate customers. However, early 2010 Chris was forced to retire due to illness and turn over the pizza paddle and oven duties to his protégé of 15 years, Horatio Hernandez. 
My decision to try Pizzeria Bianco for the first time came from a challenge I put upon myself: Find the best food in metropolitan Phoenix. After hearing about Pizzeria Bianco from a friend, I made gourmet pizza my first battle in 2009. I knew about the long lines forming an hour or more before the restaurant opened, and this beautiful fall day was no exception. I arrived 60 minutes before opening and my date went to Bar Bianco to start us off with a couple of pale ale microbrews while I held our place in line. Seeing that there were only about 20 people ahead of us, we assumed we would make the 5:00 seating with no trouble. However, just as we were holding a place for the rest of our party, so were the 20 or so people ahead of us, and when the door opened promptly at 5:00, there were now over 50 people ahead of us. Needless to say we were left waiting another hour since the restaurant seats only about 40 at a time. 
When we were seated at 6:00, the four of us started with the homemade mozzarella, local tomato and sweet basil starter with extra virgin olive oil drizzled all over as well as homemade crusty bread with a dish of EVOO with a touch of balsamic added. We ordered three pizzas, the Sonny Boy providing salami, marinara sauce and gaeta olives, the Wiseguy a sausage and mozzarella taste explosion and the Marinara with Prosciutto di Parma. All three pizzas were piping hot when they arrived, just crisp enough around the edges and loaded with the most amazing flavors your mouth has ever experienced. We left the restaurant without remembering the nearly 3 hour wait and were fully satisfied, eager for the next opportunity to drive to 623 Adams in Phoenix for another ""slice of heaven"". 
And so, after hearing of the departure of Chris from the kitchen, curiosity got the best of me. I had to challenge this place and find out if the changing of the guard made any difference in the wait time, the food quality or the overall experience I had truly fallen for. April 6, 2010 again I ventured down to 623 Adams in Phoenix to see if a Tuesday night or a new head chef had made any difference at all. My date and I arrived at approximately 4:00 pm, one hour before the doors would open. We found a line of about 25 people and looked at each other and said, almost in unison, ""Well, the wait hasn't changed"". 
Bob trotted off to Bar Bianco to find our pale ale, Four Peaks to help pass the time. We caught a glimpse of owner Chris Bianco and I told Bob how I would love to chat with him seeing as I was writing a comparison review, I also wanted to find out who was cooking tonight. Bob stalked Chris into Bar Bianco and asked him if he had any time, would he be willing to take a picture with me and answer a couple of questions. When Bob returned with another beer and Chris Bianco in tow, I was star struck and could barely speak. All I could muster up was, ""Are you cooking tonight?"" To which he replied, ""No, I have Horatio at the oven. I can't cook anymore."" I explained my evaluative writing topic and he assured me the experience would be the same. We took a picture and off he went, back to the bar. 
At 6:15pm, after 2.25 hours of complete social enjoyment we were called to our seats at the bar. We ordered the same items we had enjoyed last fall with the exception of the Marinara. The overall experience was better for me as I got to enjoy personal time with Chris. As for the meal, it was just as amazing as I remembered it from 6 months prior with Chris tossing the pie for every customer. The flavors were exactly as I remembered and the service from the staff was top notch, just like the first time. From the wait to the taste, it didn't appear that anything had changed! 
So what makes for the ""best pizza in America"" and how did Pizzeria Bianco get the tag line? Well, my opinion is flavorful ingredients, a phenomenal social experience, and an owner who lives by what he serves. To Chris Bianco and the Pizzeria Bianco staff, you haven't skipped a beat!"
5,Love it and love the GF menu.  It's amazing how many dishes they have
5,"I came here on the opening night when someone from Gin Blossoms played on a makeshift stage, the beers were 25 cents and there was no food (but you know me, we ordered a pizza from a neighborhood pizza place.) Since then, they have added a full kitchen and the food is amazing (chicken strips that were designed for diners who appreciate tempura-like batter and are over the age of four), the beer is astounding (one word: Kolsch...makes me swoon) and the people are great. It's worth the walk wherever you end up finding a space to park--even better, ride your bike over like we do! The Sunday brunch is great. All of my friends sit and wish they had a student loan that would enable them to spend at least half of the day drinking here daily. I don't blame them."
5,"My friend has raved about this place for months, so for her birthday the girls and I got together for a little pizza field trip to LGO. It was amazing! Just as good as Mozza Pizzeria in LA., but around 400 miles closer. I also love the little grocery store. Very cute things to buy."
5,"I found this place via Google while in town for business. It's tucked away in a non-descript strip mall next to a Salvation Army.

I've had dinner and lunch here, both times were good. For dinner, I had the special turkey sandwich with fries (fries weren't pipping hot when they were served, but still good); for the lunch visit, I had the original ""g"" spicy po-boy and chose the curry pasta salad as a side - tasty!

Service was friendly and efficient.
_______________

Update: 
12/10/07 - What's the first thing I do when I arrive in Phoenix? Punch in 2240 N. Scottsdale Road in my GPS and head to Green! This time around I had Thee Argentine Po-Boy with fried - Mock steak fried with onions and peppers, vegan mayo and a spicy sauce. I couldn't get enough! Very delicious

12/11/07 - After having a veggie burger and fries for lunch at a Hard Rock Cafe, I thought I'd balance it out by having something healthy for dinner - I ordered the Diablo Rice bowl with chicken and brown rice. The description looked good: veggies in a spicy sauce - but it was a little too salty for my taste and didn't finish it. Oh well, can't win them all.

12/12/07 - I was working close by, so decided to run in for lunch. I ordered the No Harm Chicken Parm sandwich with a side of tahini coleslaw. It was a little bit messy to eat by hand, with the tomato sauce and soy mozzarella oozing everywhere - still good nonetheless. The coleslaw was a nice compliment to the sandwich.

12/14/07 - I'll miss you Green!"
5,"Great customer service, competitive rates, and I always get a call right back from Jeff! Nice to have an agent who actually cares about his customers. I would recommend giving him a call."
5,"Just off University, but manages to feel like a little hide-away, and pulls off an enticing mellow atmosphere, suitable for intimate conversation.

Fish Tacos and a Margarita again please! How many times before I can force myself to experiment?"
5,"I have lived all over the US, and I have experienced extreme lows and highs with dentists, but this dental group is by far my favorite I have ever been a patient of. I can't say enough good about them, so I won't ramble.... Just love them."
5,"This place does it right, but hold on to your walet! U have to try the Yellow butter cake, its over the top."
5,Best sushi in town.
5,"I came to Timo for my birthday last week after hearing rave reviews about it from a few friends of mine. I met up with the fabulous Jennifer T. and I was so happy to check this place out!

I like any place that I get to walk in through a back door. I passed through the very chill looking patio area first, another plus in my book. Plenty of outdoor seating that looked dangerously inviting once this hot hot heat cools off. Inside was intimate, but with the large windows, it wasn't dark and depressing. Like your own little happy wine bar world.

They have an amazing wood burning oven. Normally, that itself is plenty good enough, but then there's the food that comes out of that wonderful oven. I only tried the spinach and artichoke dip, which was the best I have ever had! It didn't have a pool of oil (first time for everything!), it was so fresh, and I really appreciated seeing the bread sliced fresh right in front of us, since we were sitting at the bar. I saw several other things (flatbread)  come out of that oven, and I will have to go back to try them! Everything smelled delicious and was presented with a touch of class without being pretentious. I was also very intrigued by the eggplant dip which is apparently ""better than baba!"" 

Now for the drinks. Holy cow. I've been drinking a few years now, so safe to say, I've tried many, many drinks. Or so I thought. Coconut mojito anyone!? Made with Ciroc Coconut vodka!  As tasty as mojitos are, I don't get a long well with rum, so vodka was a pleasant surprise, and the coconut just brought the mmmmmazing factor to a whole new level. I also tried the white sangria, another 5 stars. Great wine list too- Apothic Red is one of a few reds I like, and they have it!  

The staff was top notch as well. I arrived shortly before a shift change, and both bartenders were personable and hard working, and truly seemed to enjoy what they were doing. I'm pretty bad with names unfortunately, or I would love to mention them.

I can't wait to go back! For drinks and food! I think I'd even go alone for lunch if I didn't have any company!"
5,"The Boulders was a first class experience all around.  

We stayed in a casita, which was one bedroom and had a sitting room w/fireplace (a letter on the table indicated they are no longer using the fireplaces for environmental concerns), a large bathroom and walk-in closet, and a patio with a table and four chairs.  For the ladies, there is a vanity with lighted mirror just off the bathroom.  My only small complaint about the casita was that the shower was a bit small.  The mini-bar seems to be a thing of the past, but the Boulders still features a well-stocked version with a half bottle of Cali wine, kettle cooked chips, water, soda and various liquor.  The villas were outrageous and would be great for a family reunion or that type of thing - multiple bedrooms, a large outdoor area for entertaining, with the garage (they're houses, really) converted to a bedroom.  If you're staying in a casita, it's a hike across the property to the villas - they'll take you in a shuttle bus.

The bar near the dining room was well-stocked with several single malts, and the standard cigar list.  Walk out back through the seating area, and you'll find the pool, framed by a gorgeous backdrop of a large boulder and waterfall.  A little cool for the pool in December, but it didn't seem to hamper others' enjoyment.

Looking forward to returning and enjoying more on-site amenities besides golf.  My girlfriend went to the spa for massage / pedicure and seemed pretty relaxed - what I gathered is that she enjoyed it.

There are places with cushier accommodations, but the property it sits on is what makes the Boulder's unique."
5,"Not being a big fan of chain restaurants, I wasnt super excited to eat here last night. I was however, starving and craving mexican food and wanting to try somewhere new so we ended up at Manuel's. 

OMG I loved it! The salsa's (especially the hot!) the chips, the cheese crisp with green chiles and onions, and most of all: the chilaquiles!! I LOVE chilaquiles so much and had mostly seen them only served at breakfast until I opened up Manuel's menu and there they were, just how I like them! SO good I wouldve licked the dish they were served in if I wasnt so full afterwards!

JD had a rolled quesadilla that was fantastic too and we both needed to be rolled out of there when we finished eating. It was so good though that I'm craving it again today. We will definitely be back!"
5,"I was visiting Tempe for Ironman Arizona and came down with pretty acute foot injury three days prior to the race.  The friendly receptionist at Dr. Natcher's office understood the predicament I was in and managed to fit me into Dr. Natcher's schedule within a couple hours of my call.  Dr. Natcher's is clearly both a great doctor and a great person; she is extremely competent, friendly, and sympathetic.  As an  runner and cyclist, she is also in tune with sports injuries and the mentality of an athlete. She quickly diagnosed the injury and prescribed an aggressive treatment protocol.  I was in good shape on race day (due to her treatment protocol) and am so very thankful to Dr. Natcher for putting me in the position to complete the race in fine fashion.  I was paying out-of-pocket, and  was very pleasantly surprised by the cost of the office visit.  I can't speak highly enough of my experience with Dr. Natcher."
5,"I hardly ever get past their carne adovada. It's simply amazing. Add a couple of extra homemade tortillas to it? Can't be beat! I have had their pecan crusted sea bass also, along with lamb chops (chipotle?) both very, very good. Great atmosphere, friendly, competent staff...a winning combination. Get there early! Long waits after 6:00pm!!"
5,"Bookmans is Great!  They probably don't need another positive review but so what.  I use Bookmans for recycling books I've read and for buying used books for myself.  All I can say is that I like everything about the way they do business.  They have great people working there.  The store vibe is very positive.  Their prices are very fair and what they pay for your used books is incredibly fair, plus you know that you've made a positive contribution to our society by recycling books that others can enjoy.  Do yourself a favor and stop in.  Enjoy!"
5,"So I knew ahead of time about the wait. So we got there at 3:30 and waited for an hour and a half until they opened. But we were able to be seated as soon as they opened.

Let me just say that I've never had anything even close to the kind of pizza that we got. It's outstanding! 

I highly recommend the caprese salad, antipasto and the rosa pizza. Though I'm pretty sure that it's all amazing, no matter what you get."
5,"We had read about this place on  Yelp and a local had highly recommended it as well.  It is located in an office building and not easy to find unless you know in advance that it is in the back of a big office building with a big parking lot.  I will preface this by saying that we had just eaten the night before at a highly regarded Scottsdale restaurant in which the service was awful.  Therefore, this place won a lot of points with the 4 of us immediately because the service was outstanding from start to finish.  The restaurant itself is huge and it is beautifully decorated and immaculate.  You walk in and they have a huge open fire spit BBQ chickens and Beef.  For starters we had a  Caesar Salad--a shrimp cocktail--a bit pricey and just okay, and a good house salad.  I ordered their simply grilled fish of the day which was Swordfish with Guacomole on top and a corn butter on the side served with rice.  It was a good portion and it was delicious.  My wife had Salmon on a plank which was also very good.  One of our friends had Short Ribs with Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce and grits.  The portion was huge and he raved about the dish. Our other friend had the Duck Breast and it was very good.  We had a nice wine recommended by our waitress that was reasonably priced and very good.  The whole experience was excellent and we will go again when we come back to Scottsdale."
5,I love the menu here it has many selections of many cultures including Italian!!!
5,"Drinking coffee from Cartel makes me want to get my own San Franciscan SF-25B Coffee Roaster, in much the same way I wanted my own pottery wheel after seeing the movie Ghost.

It's. That. Good."
5,"Great place, enjoyed the amenities. Pool was great and view on the property was very picturesque. Food in the property restaurants were very good. Definitely would stay there again if ever in Scottsdale again."
5,"Let's be honest, when you walk into a tanning salon if you have high hopes you'll expect to see a nice person behind the counter who is friendly and can tell you the prices for packages and the max times on the beds.  If you have low expectations you'll expect a bored teenager who hands you a price sheet and stares at you looking bored.

Walking into the Total Tan I had pretty good expectations based on the reviews and even those were blown away.  Dallas was the person who helped me (I think he's one of the owners?) and he was sooooo friendly and knowledgeable I spent more than I was originally planning but I feel good about it actually.

I had looked at the pricing online so I had an idea of what I wanted but he explained things about the beds that I never knew and that none of the other salons I'd been to had ever told me.  He was super personable too, even asking for my name just during his explanations of everything before I had committed to buying anything.  He made sure I knew every detail of the beds, the differences, gave recommendations and was never pushy with any of it.  During our conversation several people came in and he always asked my permission first to take care of them and I don't think he had to ask for their names once, a good sign that he pays attention and remembers his customers.

I could go on and on because I was so impressed with his service and also the location itself (super clean, trendy, nice extras in the rooms like baby wipes and extra towels) but I think you get the point by now.  Just check this place out, you'll be happy you did."
5,"Great experience from start to finish.  Host (who was the owner) seated us at a table with a view.  Was given house made foccacia bread and olive oil.  Was awesome.  Some of the best bread I've ever had before a meal.  The olive oil was seasoned perfectly too.  My grandma got the burger and I got the pesto penne primavera.  The pasta came with shrimp, squash, and some other vegetables.  I love pesto, so this hit the spot.  Good serving size, but not too much.  The food tasted fresh.  They make their own pasta, which was delicious.  The burger was huge.  Looked like you get your moneys worth.  The ice tea was even good.  The place was clean and sleek.  They played good music and the service was perfect.  It has been a while since I had such a good overall experience with no complaints.  I will be coming back.  The host, who we later found out was the owner, was working that night and asked us how we liked everything.  I've said it before, but that is a rare and good touch for any restaurant.  Well done."
5,"This is my favorite spot, waterfalls everywhere, beautiful flowers, fun slide, and great food!"
5,"So my friends and I had to roll each other out of the door after this meal was over but it was sooooooooo worth it!!! BEST red kool-aid ever served in jars!! BEST waffles I've EVER had!! BEST red velvet cake I've EVER had!! I also did enjoy their chicken, mac & cheese and collard greens, but none were the best I've ever had, but very good.  I seriously dream about their waffles and red velvet cake, I don't know what magic mix of ingredients make up the waffle batter but it's absolutely perfect and these waffles would stand deliciously on their own even without butter and syrup, but who'd want to do that? the red velvet slice they give you is HUGE and soooo moist, the frostings is cream cheesy delicousness. I can not wait to indulge in this treat again, but since I'm far from being the only one who loves this place, it is always packed and the wait is long, at least on the weekend. Seriously considering taking a day off of work just for a weekday Lo Lo's run =P"
5,"This place has been here 7 years and we have never been. Are you kidding me? The food is excellent. The people who work here are friendly and seem to be happy to be there, which is most important. I tried the make your own half salad and half sandwich. YUMMY!!! There are many choices for salad toppings. There us nothing I like more than a huge, fresh salad. I chose to top my salad with avocado, tomato, bacon, edemame, feta cheese, and whipped balsamic vinaigrette. I really think this was the best salad I have ever had! They make the salad in front of you and mix in the perfect amount of dressing. I chose the chicken pesto sandwich. The combo of these items was a perfect portion for this hungry girl. The sandwich was excellent. My hubby ordered the Cuban pork sandwich. This is one huge sandwich! It was difficult to get his mouth around it, but once he did, it was awesome!! Typically, we don't like coleslaw, but it was really good, especially combined with the tender pork. We will return to the Market Bistro, again and again. 
Loved it!!!!"
5,"This place has amazing frozen yogurt! I had the strawberry with small pieces of fresh strawberries! It was a wonderful treat in this heat, since it's yogurt and not ice cream, it's a little bit healthier."
5,"I love pita Jungle! Everytime I am in town, I make it a point to get here. The food is fresh and healthy(ish). There ice tea comes in a variety of wonderful flavors and is so delicious. I would recommend you eat here, especially if you like yummy food with a medditeranean flare."
5,"I need to stop going here so much, but it's hard to stay away."
5,The castle is what drew us here.  It's just the front of a castle with a reading nook in the bottom of the tower.  The 3 year old was impressed as soon as he saw it.  There is also a play area with big activity walls.  It was a little hard for my son to comprehend being quiet while playing.  Getting to the library was confusing with the GPS.  Just follow the signs and park in the garage at the end to the left when you pull in.  Well worth a one time visit.
5,"Since moving to Arizona I have selected Fry's as my new grocer and am very happy with my choice! I immediately signed up for their VIP card and love seeing the many savings listed on the receipt after every trip.

I am especially happy that I have moved closer to this Frys as it is open 24 hours and even when shopping in the wee hours of the morning can expect to see some nocturnal ASU students.

Any interactions I have had with the staff have been pleasant and enjoyable."
5,We started each morning of our vacation at The Breakfast Club.  Everything was so tasty; juices are fresh-squeezed.  Menu has quite a variety and portions are very filling  It gets busy early.  Be sure to give it a try.
5,"On my little trip around the city I drove over to Sweet Pea. Very cute store and great personable staff.

Nice selection to baked goods and great taste.

What nice find in the downtown area. I've got Wicked Bakery up north and Sweet Pea downtown... North and South is covered for those sudden cravings... now time to find something on the on West and East sides of the city."
5,Great Kobe on flatbread and the skirt steak is fantastic. Waiters are very attentive and helpful. I've eaten here twice in the days (conference) and I would go back. Their menu is diverse enough to try something new again.
5,"Our 1st visit to Renegade Canteen last night.  We made reservations and were a little late getting there,  but they had our table waiting which was nice because the place was packed.  Atmosphere is very nice.  Beautiful building and a nice layout.  Next time we plan to eat in the bar.  We had to try Bob's Big Burger and what a big burger it was!  Quality meat (bacon was to die for).  Big onion, big tomato.  What more could you ask for?  Mr. McGrath was in the restaurant and he came by our table to say hello and ask if we were enjoying ourselves.  Great guy!  And our waiter was very attentive (not pushy) but always seemed to show up at the right time.

We plan on going back for sure.  Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed.

Catch Chef McGrath on Channel 8 PBS ""Check Please, Arizona"".  He does a good job and watching the show makes you hungry.

Thanks Renegade Canteen for having us."
5,I highly reccomend this place. They helped my girlfriend and I figure out our taxes and deductions so that we could get the max refund. We both had been doing our taxes online and missing out on hundreds in deductions. Ill never use another online service to do my taxes again as long as these guys are here.
5,Just moved to AZ and this is my local Petco. Everyone's really helpful and friendly. We just took our dogs here to get groomed and they came back smelling fresh and looking clean.
5,"Until Bobby Q's entered my life i wasnt a fan of BBQ anything! made me kinda sad to see so many people enjoying some messy ribs but anyways I i digress...This place has changed my life for the better!. Their St. Louis ribs are fall off the bone AMAZING! and their Mac n Cheese is a must have! I have to admit this place has made me a bit of a ribs snob, if something doesnt come close to Bobby Q's i automatically right that place off.

A short review but you get the gist of it..."
5,"Now that I have tried all the main bubble tea/boba places in the Valley, I can say that this place is the best and most consistent. It therefore deserves five stars!"
5,"we only came across this place because an acquaintance recommended it to us. I've lived up the street from this place for years and never knew it existed, it's quite the hole in the wall and easy to pass by.

The place was super clean and the owners did a wonderful job serving everyone in a timely manner and being super attentive. We felt so taken care of!! :) 

I thought the prices were a little on the high side but when they brought out our meal all I could say was ""WHOAH!"". The portion sizes were CRAZY awesome and my hubby and I could have really split one entree and still had some leftover. 

The food was fresh, the meat tender, the atmosphere pleasantly divine! 2 trips now and I'm such a fan! :D"
5,"They have the friendliest staff at this Whole Foods. They know me by name and always have samples ready for the little boy I nanny before we even walk up to the Deli counter. Maureen the checker, Kathy in vitamins, and Daniel & Paula in the Deli are all exceptional- go see them if you need anything they will be happy to help."
5,"We drove in from LA for spring training.  Had a free evening and the old Pizza Hut remake looked interesting.  To our great surprise, we had one of the best Thai meals in a long time.  Once you get inside, you'll forget this used to be an old Pizza Hut and you'll be transported to a bit of Southeast  Asia.  Good food, good service...and the price is great.  I loved the eggplant with beef and the Pad See Yew (spelled differently).  Was going to go again, but they close on Sundays...boo.  Don't know if it's consistently this good, but for our one night in Phoenix, we were pleasantly surprised.  Definitely worth a try if you're looking for good Thai food.  You don't necessarily have to have a lot of heat in your food because they have plenty of dishes for chili-adverse people like me but it's there for those that need the heat.  The food presentation and description will remind you of Chinese cuisine, but the flavors are unique and delicious...and definitely NOT Chinese.  The Thai fried rice is definitely more than a side dish...it's a meal in itself.  Try this place and you won't be disappointed."
5,Fantastic venue! The bartenders are nice- the drinks are excellent. The lounge is an amazing place to hang out (best downtown spot?!) even if you aren't going to the show! Cool free shows in the lounge! Now let's talk about the main reason you would go there- THE MUSIC! And the venue itself is awesome! The sound is great! The ROOM IS GREAT! It was designed by someone who knew what concert goers want- an intimate experience with fantastic sound. And so if you have the curse of ALWAYS standing behind the TALLEST DUDES EVER at shows- you can now take advantage of the bleacher seating in the back of the room or benches on the side. THERE IS NOT A BAD SEAT IN THE HOUSE! What is left to say ? GET THERE!
5,"I dig the breakfast been to 7th and 38th and had Nan's breakfast, Plus have had tamales too so really is something to come back. In 13-years (I live in Cali) been here 26 times and not fancy (although 7th is the one with great pottery and colors inside. I ate 1 time for lunch of dinner and 25 times for brekafast"
5,"Mouth watering. That's all I have to say.

The food at this place is seriously amazing. Everything we tasted was better than the dish before it, and we had a fabulous bottle of white wine to accompany our meal. The scallops were a highlight, as was the potato pie dish (that's not a very technical name for what it was, but that's my best effort). It was all very, very good, and the only thing keeping us from returning is the cost! We genuinely enjoyed our evening here, and we will absolutely go back, but it is pricey, especially for the size of the dishes.

The atmosphere and ambiance are so fun, and this place is a little dressier and trendier than some other places we've been in Scottsdale. I highly recommend this for a night out with friends, or a cool date night. It seemed as though reservations would be a good idea, although we didn't have them and were okay (it was busy, though)."
5,"By far the best asian market in the entire valley! I first discovered Lee Lee's tempe location and was so happy when they opened this location in the west valley.  Amazing selection from produce, meats, and asian. The staff is super nice. Never have had a poor experience in all the years. Shelves are clean and organized.  Prices are great too."
5,"Feeling a bit weary from a steady stream of travel, we decided to head over here for my favorite Rx, Pho.

A couple of summer rolls filled with shrimp, pork and vermicelli, dipped in the sweet peanutty sauce, a dash of their house hot sauce(a tad more fire than the ""cock"" sauce) and we were off to  a fine start. I was feeling better already.

The Pho arrived, and the aromas were simply intoxicating. After a short interlude of vaporized euphoria, we dug in, adding the usual lime, cilantro, basil, sprouts and aforementioned hot sauce. Commence slurping.

The broth was simple yet complex in layered flavors. Noodles were perfect in abundance and texture. My companion chose beef and shrimp and declared they were cooked perfectly. I selected the special beef which included shank, brisket, tendon, tripe and meatball. Outstanding.

Service was with a smile, prompt and attentive. I honestly felt like I was sitting in someone's home enjoying what they might eat on a daily basis. I do not think that Cyclo can compare, while good, this just seemed more authentic."
5,"Been a patron since this eatery first opened.  This is honestly one restaurant that has not been hurt by the economy.  The food is that fabulous!  My absolute favorite salad is the Turkey Waldorf.  My children always get the side Caesar with Potato Cream Cheese Soup.  The husband always gets either a Cranberry Scone and Onion Bagel slathered with cream cheese OR a Pretzel and some sort of sandwich.  

The only downside to this eatery is their lack of seating space during the lunch rush hour.  Get there by 11am if you actually want to sit inside, otherwise on a windy and cold winter day you might find yourself outside sitting on the patio (as I have done in the past.)

Even with the lack of seating during rush hour lunch....I'm giving this place five stars and making sure I'm there before the rush hour.  :-)  Happy Eats!"
5,"This place is absolutely amazing.  If you are looking for a quick sweet treat this is the place to go.  It a little hole-in-the-wall looking place, but once you take a bite into one of their homemade ice cream sandwiches, your mind will change.  I usually go for the mint ice cream with chocolate chip cookie, but when it's fall, I can't pass up the pumpkin ice cream with snicker doodle cookie. I've never found anything like it since."
5,"This place is a gem. The food is amazing. It's cheap. The service is good. My favorite part? The place never changes. I can walk through the door and Ali already knows my order. The Chicken Shawarma special comes with their hand-made pita - so soft and delicious. The chicken is seasoned perfectly and comes with a yummy little dollop of garlic sauce. I've never found better hummus in my life. I've had it all around town, in New York, in L.A. (ick...L.A. *shudder*). SO good! The iced tea has a hint of rose water. OH and the gyro? Hands down, the best in town.

Did I mention they have a market attached? Talk about the best price on spices in town! The spices come in little plastic sealed pillows, so get some spice jars from Ikea and stock up!

I couldn't get through this without mentioning the lamb tongue. I am no connoisseur of organ meats, but this sandwich is like the most tender lamb you've ever had in your life. Shut up and try it.

The only sad part about Haji's is that they close early. Usually 8pm on a week-night, but totally worth getting to-go orders if you can swing in on your way home from work!"
5,"This is the only work of his that I have seen in person. After living in the valley since 2002, I FINALLY decided to head out that way.  I found the information about the life and times of Frank Lloyd and his 3rd wife very interesting. The house was amazing and beautiful. I especially loved the local rocks cast into the concrete, and the lines that created a flow.   I would highly recommend this tour to any one with an interest in form, function, and beauty."
5,"I am a huge fan of this restaurant. I love their locally grown fruits and veggies. I love their healthy options. I had their brown rice with curry sauce, veggies, and organic chicken...it was incredible! Can't wait to travel to Arizona again and return to this wonderful restaurant!
PLEASE OPEN ANOTHER LOCATION IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA! It would be a hit!"
5,Love this place. Great Happy Hour.
5,"There's no business like show business. As any of my friends will tell you I am a theater junkie. I could sit in a theater all day, all week, all year long and do nothing but gaze at live performances of theatrical talent. lol! Well in actuality, hmmmmmmm I really could. I am not even joking on that. I probably would if someone brought me water every now and again. LOL!  Ok, seriously now, Childsplay is my favorite organization in Az for a host of reasons. 
   My dear friends of Childsplay know who they are. This is children's theater at it's best! The Q and A sessions after each show is a plus. The kids love it. I have to admit I do too since I get to go say hi to my friends after each stage-show. I also learn more techniques that I can steal when I teach drama to my inner city students. Teehee!  ( Yes I am a teacher and yes I would die to have some of their costumes and sets) 
   I have seen so many wonderful plays, literature remakes, and original scripts performed At TCPA and by Childsplay. Fernidad, BFG and New Kid were only some of the most amazing masterpieces I have had the distinct pleasure of viewing from these talented actors. Debbie, Scott, Katie, Jodi; well all of them! LOVE YOU!
   Childsplay also has an artist in Residence program for schools. We have had an artist at our school for several years. It is wonderful to note that the teaching techniques classroom teachers are learning are helping tomorrows future. Time after time I have seen struggling kids blossom under their tutelage.  
   Of importance to note, TCPA is a beautiful facility. You can enjoy a nice venue along with the superstar talent. What more can you ask for?  
   The only negative I can possibly imagine is that in today's hard times the cost may be inhibiting to some families. But if you like them on Facebook they sometimes have discounted tickets and contests to win free tickets. A great way to start viewing them and get involved.
    I do hope everyone continues to support the arts here in Az. As I have stated in my other ""ARTS"" reviews, I do worry about cultural program survival in Az with recent state budget cuts. Soooooooo, as a famous circus/rodeo person once said, ""Go, On With The Show""."
5,"The Rosson House Museum is a restored home from the 1895's.  And it's also conveniently right next to the Teeter House Tea Room and across from Pizzeria Bianco.  

For under $5, you can take a guided tour of Rosson House and learn what life was like for its residents so long ago. It's a really cool activity to do, and since it's close to so many great restaurants, you can go for dinner and drinks after your tour. 

Walking through the home, it's easy to imagine the lady of the house sipping tea in a dainty cup with her lacy gloves on. 
Or maybe it's just me. 

Houses like this tend to creep me out. I half-expected to see a ghostly woman in a pinafore around every corner, but let me tell you, I'm glad I didn't. 

Either way, coming to Heritage Square and exploring the historic buildings in it is a great way to spend an afternoon."
5,This is a great hole in the wall shop off of Val Vista Rd. I've been getting the chicken salad sandwich since 2006 and it's the same ever since GREAT! Cookies and bread are awesome as well...
5,"AMAZING. Everything we had was the best we have eaten; sushi, crab cakes, oysters!  It's a MUST if near the Scottsdale Quarter!  We chose to eat there 2 nights in a row, once for a reserved dinner and the other for the happy hour."
5,"Great time, great location, ability to park in garage behind it. Beautiful decor, candles, white furnishings, trimmed in wood. Excellent vodka choices that will have you dancing on that raised table all nite which gives you a cool panoramic view of the place. See if you can spot the dj booth! He's cool, friendly door staff. The bartenders kind of ignore you and there's a brunette girl bartender-stay away from her. Downer attitude, and she will charge you for 2 drinks even though they have a 2 for 1 special. But it's a cool club and it's 99% certain you'll have great time."
5,"a G Spot is a myth.  and Dr Graffenberg was a mad scientist.

So its no surprise that I couldn't find the Gelato Spot either.  Shannon spouts, ""I love gelato so much, I would bathe in it"".  Hmmm, that's interesting

I drove in and around the dirt road
... and went up and down Scottsdale 
... explored the box
... looked south of the landing strip at Scottsdale Airpark
... manually googled it
... orally asked the passerbys

Road several times and I couldn't find it ANYWHERE

Maybe I need to do more research.  Perhaps some field research...Or a targeted focus group

*** UPDATE  ***
Its on Shea Blvd??  No wonder I couldn't find it-
I was looking down the wrong road

*** UPDATE  ***
Thanks Jake P for ""Yeah it is on Shea, in the strip mall area east of scottsdale rd near the Harkins Theater and Pita Jungle and such.... ""
BUT the point of this review was sarcasm.  i.e. g- spot is hard to find

*** UPDATE  ***
Now I have a girl, ""Shannon W"", telling me where g-spot is.  She writes, 
""It's on 74th St. and Shea, in between Coffee Plantation and Pita Jungle.""
Shannon W:  The point of this review was sarcasm.  i.e. g-spots are hard to find"
5,"I love Stinkweeds.  Owned by local commerce booster Kimber Lanning, Stinkweeds provides better selection and pricing than many national vendors.  The staff are helpful, and if they don't have what you're looking for, they'll happily special order it for you.   The parking lot is smallish, but I've never had a problem finding a space.  The central location is a big plus.  They share the plaza with other locally-owned businesses, so it makes for a fun shopping excursion.  Their listening stations are well-stocked with a variety of music, and the staff loves to talk music, as well.  They also carry a great selection of music mags, as well as some books."
5,"If you want a good meal that will fill ya up, for a fair price...Wally's is a great choice!

The menu has great variety.  If you want a burger, there are many to choose from.  Each is huge and juicy, and comes with your choice of a side....go with the blended fries that include deliciious sweet potato fries.

Want a salad?  Again, many to choose from...my favorite is the chinese chicken.  And, in case you missed my earlier comments, expect a BIG salad.

And, if you're not watching your calories, then try any of their specialty mac'n'cheese dishes.  WOW!

I can't comment on the desserts because I can't eat anything beyond the entrees...but, I've seen others order a dessert; they looked yummy and - you guessed it - HUGE!

And, here's the thing about Wally's:  they're ""good people"".  in addition to providing you with a great meal, Wally's staff are active supporters of non-profit organizations in the greater Phoenix area.  I have first-hand knowledge of their support for the Valley of the Sun Unted Way, and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Scottsdale.  I have no doubt they support other causes."
5,"My mother and I were actually getting out of the car to go to Streets of New York next door when she smelled the Mexican food and suggested we try Roberto's instead.  That should tell you what you need to know right there.

It's a hole in the wall place for sure, and leaves much to be desired visually, but the staff was exceptionally pleasant and the tables were clean.  If you're looking for fine dining, this isn't your place.  At $7-$10 for an entree, though, it was delicious.

Beans, rice, and chips were pretty standard, but the salsa, fish taco, and shredded beef tostada were very flavorful.  The food tastes homemade, and in this case, that's a good thing.

This place was also featured on TLC's Diners and Drive-ins show back in the day.  One of Anthem's best kept secrets.  I'll be back!"
5,I love Petco! The only place I go to get dog food. I feel like the employees generally know what they are talking about and are always willing to help!
5,"I'd have to say that among the restuarants in the Tom Jetland suite (Fez, Ticoz, Switch), Ticoz is my favorite because of its dimly-lit lounge-like quality, which provides it a cozier feel than the other two.  Add to that, the hypnotic Mojito creations and Ticoz is one of those places I could spend an entire weekend late afternoon at, as long as someone else drives, of course.

The tamales are fantastic and are more similar to corn pudding than to traditional hand rolled tamales.  If you get them with veggies, you'll find that the veggies are a little oddly cut for the dish, so I recommend some other topping.  The beef is fantastic (especially in the tacos).

All in all, this is one of my current favorites."
5,"Does anyone know why their regular subs are $1 more than all the other Jimmy John's? Or is that just when it's delivered, instead of charging a standard delivery fee? I've noticed that with the other types of sandwiches too, and extras...the slim is $4 instead of $3.25, and extra avo is $1.75 instead of $0.75

That's not going to stop me from ordering though :-) Still love their sandwiches...they make the best veggie sub I've had. They load it up with veggies, whereas I have to ask for extra everything at a certain other sub chain and then they still barely put any on. I'd much rather pay a little bit extra for Jimmy John's :-)"
5,"I was very impressed and surprised by the quality of this restaurant!  This place is STYLISH - whether it's the plush lounge chairs on the patio, or the old school movies being projected on the walls - there's definitely an element of class that is rare for the Mill Avenue district.

First impressions were extremely positive - the place was busy but not packed, candlelit tables, and dim lighting provides the perfect atmosphere for a date, but not too much so that it causes that uncomfortable, formal, anxiety feeling.  La Bocca almost seems like an AZ88 in Tempe for those who are fans.  

I was pleasantly surprised at the prices on the menu.  Most items were in the $10-15 range, and I was immediately intrigued by the various pizza selections.  I focused my sights on the garden pizza, which took me by surprise because it was basically a chef-tossed salad on a really good pizza crust.  My girlfriend went with the bruschetta planks and chose two homemade pesto, one mozarella basil, and one roasted artichoke - DELICIOUS!

Top that off with a few glasses of really good sangria and you've got a really good meal for right around the $40-50 mark.  Needless to say we will be returning!"
5,"I have been living in Arizona for 4 years and have yet to find a decent Italian Beef Sandwich, until now.  I even gave the same statement to the owner.  I had ordered an Italian Beef for carry out, and while I was waiting, I let him know my frustrations.  He gave me his card and told me to call him after I ate the sandwich because he wanted to know what I thought.  Well, it was FANTASTIC!  Of course, I called him back to let him know.  

The service, and the time and effort put into the food cannot be beat.  This is what you get for a mom and pops type place.  

There are plenty of other sandwiches and foods there too.  I can't wait to go back and try some more!"
5,"God Bless Lifetime Fitness.

First off, let me tell you how much I despise working out.  Like, at times I'd rather drink my own pee than even come within 50 feet of the stair stepper.  

However, LTF (have you noticed that I like to abbreviate?  Get used to it friends...)  makes my gym experience fairly painless.  Steve W, I salute you for aknowledging the value of such a fine work-out establishment, and I actually have many of the same opinions. But because I like to hear myself talk, I'll reiterate some of my favorite points.

First off, I'm absolutely not a fan of children.  Especially at a gym.  Lifetime has FREE childcare for kiddos 12 and under so us singles can flirt our way through our workout without your kids sniffling and screaming.  Kids can play and swim outside under parental supervision at the pool, complete with waterslides and some kid-specifc water fountain spray thing.  They love it.  And I do too.  WATERSLIDES?  I mean come on.  LoveitLoveit.

Lifetime's members span the board, which is nice because I like the fact that I'm not the most out of shape person there.  I also like that there is nice scenery to watch and inspire me to keep my feet on that god forsaken stair stepper.  You may even see a professional athelete or TV personality on occasion.  Who doesnt love that?

You never wait for a piece of equipement because there are tons of machines.  And they are not covered in meathead sweat, which is always nice.

My favorite part of LTF is the group classes.  Excellent teachers, classes every day of the week, and a good variety of options.  I'd like to see more coreographed classes like Hip-Hop, but whatever, Kickboxing Jam is pretty damn close.   

Locker rooms are always spotless, towel service is free, sauna and steam rooms arent full of weirdo naked people, and they have this device that dries your bathing suit in under a minute.  Ingenious!  

I've been a member of a ton of Scottsdale gyms but I drive the extra 20 minutes in rush hour to go to the Tempe LTF.  Doesnt road rage burn calories anyway??  Win-win situation."
5,"I cannot believe all these negative reviews. 

First I'd like to start with the prices. Don't get me wrong, I love a good deal, BUT, if you are going to complain about how jobs in America are moving to China and India and not shop at AA because of their prices, then you are a hypocrite. AA supports US jobs and their factory is here in the states where they actually care about ethics and their employees. And, they have sales too, I have been in this store more than a few times and seen 30% - 50% off sale signs. And, on their website you can shop the sale section and save up to 75% if not more.

To the clothes - I understand some people may be weirded out and flash back into the 80's when they see the clothes here, as I have read from the reviews on here, BUT, these clothes are actually very stylish and a simple top with a simple pencil skirt  from AA and with some accessories you have a fab outfit. If you are looking for something not so simple try a white strapless romper with their petticoat skirt, add some accessories, and your done. 

The sizes - I am size 4-6 with curves, and the clothes from here fit me fine. I can understand the frustration if you are a little bigger and have had a hard time fitting into the clothes from AA. But, the good thing is that AA is now coming with XL sizes in some of their clothing. 

The models - I love the fact that the models are real and barefaced. As someone who has struggled with a skin condition, I always hate walking around the mall only to see photoshopped perfect faces surrounding me. I always feel comfortable when I walk into AA.

This store - I have never had a bad experience. Always a good one. i like the store, the employees have always been nice to me, I have no complains."
5,"All I can say is ""yum!"""
5,"Great service by Angela and their Doc
First time I don't have to wear reading glasses as they switched me to a mono contact
Very enjoyable experience and very quick
Had a issue with a contact and they track a replacement done right away
Definitely recommend"
5,"Back when I lived in Phoenix this was one of the only places I bothered with eating at. Started by a Chicagoan who moved to Phoenix, they get deep dish right and make just about everything else in the style of delicious. I was in town last week to hike the Grand Canyon and stopped in. Man, I miss their food. Thank God I live in Chicago and can get something similar! Be warned though. Their food is BIG."
5,"We went to check out PNP for their 2 Year Anniversary show and were extremely impressed!  Space 55 is the most charming space that I never would've known existed had it not been for this show being promoted on Yelp!  The actors were amazing and we really were in awe the entire time we watched this 30 minute film being created right in front of us!  I'd heard of Comedy Improv, but Movie Improv?  I had no clue... 

Special shout outs to Mark J and Jenn H (our very own Phoenix yelpers) who did an incredible job on Saturday night.  Congrats again, PNP, on your 2 year anniversary!  I look forward to attending future performances for sure!"
5,We went there right before my Grandma's 100th birthday.  There were about 20 of us.  The place was busy but we called ahead and they put our name in even though we still didn't have a final count of people.  The place was busy but I know why.  EVERYONE had a different dish and we all loved it.  Everyone wanted to taste each others food because we all liked it so much.  We all seem to think we are food critics and we loved this place.  Extensive menu and they seemed to nail everything we had!  The staff was amazing and would go back in a heartbeat!
5,"This is seriously one of my favorite restaurants of all time. I've been many times and it's always fabulous. I LOVE their Mahi Mahi Tacos - they are so good! I also highly recommend the Pork Osco Bucco, Smoked Red Chile Pork Roast, and the Cowboy Beef Stew. The nightly specials are often very creative and delicious. This place is also good for Sunday brunch. Good bartender too - drinks are never too weak."
5,"There's a certain amazingness that comes from fresh made ice cream.  It's soft, creamy, and not filled with high fructose corn syrup and preservatives to keep it together for months in a freezer.  Growing up in Arizona, we always made homemade ice cream in the summer and if you've never experienced homemade ice cream, just go to Churn.
I had the banana ice cream with caramel sauce on top.  I can't say anything bad about it at all.  If someone doesn't like their ice cream, it's because they've been subject to all the fakeness added to ice cream in the stores and national ice cream shop chains.  
The shop has lots of toys and candy and knickknacks that will give you a sense of nostalgia.  I'll tell you what sounds like the best day ever:  riding my bike down Central on a beautiful Phoenix day... stopping in to Churn for an ice cream break (and then popping into one of the restaurants nearby for a cocktail)."
5,I've been coming here for years...the best.  One of my favs is the lulu wings.
5,We have had nothing but good luck at this franchise so far. We've been here probably a dozen times. It's always clean and the food is fresh and the way it ought to be. Yum!
5,"If you are looking for top-notch produce and organic goodies then NGD is the best. Pricing can't be beat and it's delivered as well. Always great quality, and a large selection. Easy ordering process and awesome customer service. One of the reasons I am sad not to live in Scottsdale anymore."
5,"What an amazing Mini Vacation.  I went in August which was about 105 degrees but it was perfect.  The pool was relaxing, the water felt great and I enjoyed all three nights of my stay.  We decided it was so great we never left the resort.  

The Room was very clean and very comfortable.  

Talavera had the most amazing Fish Entrees, the seabase OMG I can still taste it, the salmon was the best I have ever had, and I dislike salmon completely.  The service through out the restaurant and hotel was amazing.  The special drinks they had were very tasty and made the 105 degrees weather manageable.  

The brunch buffet and breakfast at Crescent Moon is excellent all three days, so fresh, the pomegranate fresh juice was amazing I had three.  The food tasted like the items were freshly picked that morning.  I literally gained 5 ILBs on this trip and it was worth all of it.  

The Lounge had tasty small Tapas which I enjoyed while it drizzled that night, the whole hotel has a great relaxing ambiance.

The nights were amazing to walk around the hotel or sit around the pool with the night lights on and enjoy the peacefulness of the resort.  I believe we saw bats flying around in the middle of the night. which was very cool.  

Worth every penny.  Just watch out for Camera Speed Traps on the way there.  Enjoy,"
5,"We'll take this over Godiva any day!   The staff is always so friendly and they're always nice enough to give my kids (all 4) a sample, too.    Nothing compares to their chocolates, especially the the vanilla milk chocolate, Brown Sugar Milk Chocolate and Coconut Milk Chocolate!  Don't forget the lollipops that last FOREVER for the kids!!  Just make sure you have a few wipes on hand!"
5,The best Asaian store around. Love the selection. Awesome smoked herring for cheap. Everything is so much cheaper and better than any other Asian store I've been.
5,"Cheese Curds!   They have been so hard to find in AZ.    Like the Jalepeno ones too.

Really good fresh milk.   Worth the stop.

Bring cash, not credit or debit cards"
5,"Grew up in San Antonio and Austin. Have traveled extensively and sampled BBQ all over the country. The term Texas-style means beef, first. Period. And good smoke, and that ain't mesquite. Oak is king. These guys have changed the face of Phoenician BBQ forever. It's a shame that the Scottsdale location was touched by ... well, Scottsdale. Friggin morons. If you have not been here, you need to go down to 24th and E. Roeser and try it. Hands down the best Q in the area, including Cave Creek. The guys are FROM Texas and they know the whats, wheres and hows of Bar-B-Que. 

And for those ""the meal in a carton on butcher paper"" snobs who think that such is declasse, please, do me a favor... Head on down to Austin or, better yet, Lockhart. Stand at the front of the line at Stubbs or Black's or Kruez Market and loudly proclaim your thoughts as a BBQ aficionado. Just let me know when you are heading down so I can hang out and watch the ensuing festivities. Freud said it best: BBQ and being horrifically anally-retentive is ALL about your unfulfilled dreams of your Auntie Ma. Or, shut up and grow up ya infantile gomers..."
5,"Great little place in a great little neighborhood. Food was great, service good and friendly and sitting amongst the rose bushes and garden made one feel as if we were having a nice relaxing Sunday breakfast in our backyard. Love the place."
5,I was very sad to see this restaurant go. I wish Anthony the best and hope he opens up somewhere else!
5,"All around great food.  True Texas brisket experience.  Meat has great flavor and tasty sides add variety to the offerings.  Don't forget about the sheet cake for dessert!!  I'll be back.  

***Read another review on here talking about wings.  They don't have wings here!!  Get your reviews right people."
5,"I don't think there is anything else to be said about Delux, it's been around and they offer nothing but great food; the Classic Burger and the Delux burger are both very delicious.  I like Delux better and I do recommend medium rare; the quality of the meat is unbelievable.  Love the sweet fries; I do prefer the mixture of both sweet and regular fries."
5,"I realize L&L is a chain, but I love their food. My favorites are the Loco Moco and the BBQ Chicken. I also enjoy their haupia-filled donuts. The family that runs this place is very friendly and do a great job in making sure you will enjoy your meal. Go there."
5,"Brought my parents here for lunch last time they were in town.  Dad loved his gyro. Mom and I both got large salads, hers chicken and mine gyro meat.  SO much delicious food for not a lot of money.  Between my Mom and I's leftovers I had a full dinner to eat later.  

Hooray for pleasing the parents!!"
5,"The staff is great, the food is great, even the cappuccino is great (had my first one today).

i work close by and I have a choice where to eat and it's very often Acacia for breakfast and lunch.

A few of my favs are:

- Chicken Salad Sandwich
- Southwest Ranch Salad
- Omelets

Enjoy! (maybe I'll run into you there)"
5,"I don't have much time to write this, but I do want to say a few things. 

I had four things so far here. My friend and I both enjoyed them immensely. I paid $16 + tip. 

I had the [A1 - Cha Gio - crispy egg rolls ] & [A2 - Goi Cuon Thit Tom - spring rolls] to start.

Oh man was this delicious. The first thing I loved when I walked in was the ambiance. Dim lit and let the sun do the lighting - very zen - if you're into that. I felt very comfortable here.

They had four sauces on the table. I have no idea what they are, but the one with red pepper flakes and oil -- the darker one -- oh wow. If you like heat added to whatever you're doing -- wow -- this stuff is for you! I loved it. 

Then I went with the Pho tai - sirloin soup. [P2* - Pho tai] - wow - broth was amazing. Everything was. 

For me, enjoying food means I need a few things. 

First - awesome food
Second - ambiance
Third - presentation

They had it all. I was very impressed by place to the plates. Don't change a thing. I hope  your business is very prosperous!"
5,"Tarbell's is top notch in all areas!  Food quality, service, ambience, amazing!  I recently took ten business associates there for a meeting, and I got nothing but compliments the next day on such an excellent choice of restaurant!  

Definitely try the Spaghetti & Meatballs as well as the Mac N Cheese, and even the Pizzas are to die for.  And the burger too!  You really cant go wrong here.  Warning the deserts here are HUGE (yet amazing).  One desert is enough for 2-3 people!"
5,"These are some great cheesesteaks. I have come here multiplier times and have never left unhappy. The staff are nice and the food is delicious.  
Also try the 'Cheesesteak Fries' they are freakin amazing! I am glad I work next to this place, always a great lunch."
5,"Fantastic experience from valet to dessert!! Boyfriend and I were both very impressed. We were graciously greeted the moment we walked in by a man in a suit who walked us to the restaurant. Our server was knowledgeable about all the items on the menu and suggested some things to try when we were waffling between a few different choices. Cheese trio platter was sooooo good. I'll be getting that every time we come here and it was the perfect size for the two of us to share. I had the beet salad which was very good. Love the candied walnuts in it. Boyfriend had the lamb which he said was perfect: Tender, juicy and delicious!  The breads that came at the beginning of the meal were obviously homemade and fresh. Even the coffee was good. It's very rare for us to find a place that does it right so completely but I think we've found it.  Service was fantastic! Our glasses were never empty and we were well attended without being pestered. Could it be possible I can't find anything to criticize?! I can't. Love this place."
5,"This is the new mecca of Phoenix music. 

Charlie Levy who booked for the now legendary Nita's Hideaway and also the owner of Stateside Presents is the man behind it all! He is a music fan first and ... well ... that's just what he is ... a music fan not a natural businessman. 

The place is just beautiful (for now, soon to be broken with the wear and tear of rock and roll no doubt). The room is small ... stage big (for the size) ... no doubt this is going to be the best place in the city to see any band for a long time to come!

Thank you Charlie!

Music fans unite! This place MUST thrive!

btw ... they have live music every single night of the week ... and they open at 4pm every day (the lounge will have musicians and DJs for your entertainment)."
5,"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Phoenix. This is where we go to celebrate and to enjoy a night out with amazing food and great service. Noca is an experience. I wouldn't recommend trying to quickly hit up a meal here before trying to catch a movie. I can't imagine trying to rush the experience!

On our most recent visit I immediately ordered my favorite cocktail- the Dirty Bird. It's so perfectly crafted and smooth...plus there are bleu cheese stuffed olives. Sold! I felt a little bad because my fiance wanted to celebrate our new jobby-jobs with prosecco... my bad. Lay off me when there's bleu cheese stuffed olives and vodka involved mister!

First up was the mixed salad. I love how it's not overloaded with cheese and candied fruit. It's the perfect balance of flavors. 

We then had the lobster roll and it was absolutely heavenly. I really hated to share that but I needed to save room for the scallops. The scallops were so perfectly cooked and the plating was gorgeous. The flavors were outstanding- absolutely sublime. Ryan actually asked me if I remembered his name. I just smiled."
5,"I am giving Ajo Al's on Shae five stars because I've been there regularly for about two years and it's always good. Now let me point out two issues: I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, and I only get the Tacos Del Mar or Ono Fajitas which are versions of the same thing. The chips are fresh made and great as are the salsa and hot salsa (more peppery and hot). For appetizers the Chili Con Queso Dip and Nachos are good sized and tasty. For a friend and I this location is somewhat out of the way but we still go regularly. Try it.

Detail:

Like I said I'm not exactly a fan of Mexican food. I like the Americanized fast-ish food chains: Qdoba, Chipotle even Baja Fresh. I've eaten at actual Mexican restaurants in Mexico and had home cooked Mexican fish tacos and tamales. It's growing on me but these are not tastes I grew up with.

I have a friend who loves Ajo Al's, she lived next to it or something. So I pretty much got dragged there about two years ago and I liked it right away. Like I said, I've only really eaten the fish tacos but they're the best I've had. The fish is good, the sides are good, idk what chipotle cream is but it's good, good service, the chip lady is nice, all the wait staff have been good.

It's typically not crowded but sometimes your go there and the place is close to full. I've never waited to be seated though. I've never tried the bar area. The water seams better than tap water...a dumb observation but I usually drink water rather than soda so I mention that. They give you a pitcher of water on seating and refill if needed. The chips and salsa are endless and excellent. Service is always good.

Two friends typically get the Pollo Con Queso and swear it's the best ever. I've had it as left-overs and it's good but not really my thing.

This is the only Ajo Al's I've been to...no comment on the rest of this chain."
5,"Yes, she did go to another...it's a hobby what can I say.

By far, this is the LARGEST club I've been in! But my list of places to visit is still very long, so there may be bigger. I liked it here, the girls and managers, and this is important to me, were chill and nice. Some variation in looks for the girls but not much, but then again, maybe there is more to select from at night. I'm a day club visitor, because I hate to pay cover and other unnecessary costs. This place has a nice size bar, and a freaking huge main stage, with three, yes count them, three two-story tall poles (And some of the girls climb all the way to the top!). And it doesn't end there, there was a more private but large room toward the back with another stage and tall pole. There's an upstairs to this place too! I like to wander, I have a curious sense of adventure. I found multiple smaller private rooms up there, along with small mirrored rooms with single chairs. You know for that kind of one-on-one that no ones all up in your business about kind of room, just you and the dancer...Then there is the balcony that wraps around the upper floor, plenty of seating, with DJ in the center, spinning whatever the ladies on stage ask for (this is rare, some DJ's will tell you to take a flying leap if you demand a song, so I've been told...). This place is lit well too, not enough to make you run out screaming of blindness, but good enough to see. 

May I add that this is the first time I didn't have to go through a dressing room full of half-naked women to get to the restroom, it was separate and had more than one toilet in it, yes, amazing I know! I've been won over, lets see the other places on my list top this!"
5,"The pizza is incredible, they use really high quality ingredients and the prices are great. I would recommend cooking it on the bottom rack of your oven for a slightly better texture on the crust.

I want someone to mark that this post is funny, so I will add a joke:

Mushroom walks into a bar... Bartender says, ""sorry, we don't serve your type here."" Mushroom says ""why not? I'm a fungi (fun guy)."""
5,"We came here for lunch and were a little leery when we first walked in. I had the cream of leek soup, my mother had the sausage salad, and my aunt had the Greek salad and we were all very impressed. We took a bangers and mash pasty to go, but we are so full, that it'll be awhile before we can try it. The service was a little slow, but the quality of food and atmosphere made up for the inconvenience."
5,There is no shortage of Mexican restaurants in AZ and this one is one of the tops on my list.  It's not your average Mexican fast food.  It's a little more pricey but well worth it.  Their bean and cheese burrito is so good (they say no lard and I don't know what else they use to make it good).  Their carne asada and pastor tacos are done to perfection.  I stop by whenever I pass by this place.
5,"DV Nail, may I help you? YES! You can - and always well. I've been going to DV Nails for years and they're great. I've ""cheated"" on them a few times when I hear of similar nail shops in the area offering specials and mini hot stone massages with a manicure but I always end up back at DV Nail. 

Their massage chairs are wonderful - strong massagers. You actually feel like you're getting worked on. They're clean, friendly and always do a great job for the price. It's not fancy by any means and I wish they'd turn on the radio instead of the fuzzy TV but they're consistently good. They carry every Essie & OPI color and my manicures always last a long time. A manicure & pedicure is $28 total + tip. I think that's great. 

I typically request Tina or Julie - they both take their time and do great. Don't be fooled by this place... there's often a long wait. I'd recommend an appointment."
5,"I had lunch today at CASK 63 with a banker to discuss our collective power to create business in the Phoenix Market. I HAD THE ABSOLUTE BEST CRAB SALAD, I've had since leaving the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. Red Crab Salad....fresh, clean, sweet, crisp..light...in a very well appointed setting. Very  good iced teas as well....hard to find in Phoenix.....Go there...Eat there...you will like it..and we might see one another...who knows...be like nike..just do it...:)"
5,"Truly the best pizza I've had so far in AZ. Reminded me of NY pizza, thin crust... and crusty! I could eat this crust alone it's so good!..  
In fact I did!!! Ate it with a little olive oil and it was yuyuyummy! Also had the antipasti, so glad they actually give you REAL antipasti and not a mesh of crazy salad... you have to try this place if you haven't already.  My husband and I got a small pizza and had enough to take home for leftovers... and we are BIG eaters! RICO!!!"
5,"When was the last time that you went to a restaurant and were still bragging about your experience two weeks later??? This is exactly what I am doing about the ""Arrogant Butcher.""

I went there a couple of weeks ago with a bunch of folks from work. We had a private dining area and our servers name was Mark. He truly made the experience AMAZING!  His detailed, vivid descriptions of the entrees and desserts were comical and had most of us in tears. You could almost smell and taste each item as he passionately went into detail.  The appetizer- soft pretsels with cheese..OH EM GEE!!!!!!!!  Why doesn't every restaurant have these??? The crab stuffed chicken......AMAZING!

We shared several desserts, one which was a peanut butter cup......stand back Reese's......you have competition now!! =)

The manager came in later and had a professional, yet funny, manner about him as well.  What a great team they are."
5,Awesome food. Highly recommend. Had gyros platter . Generous portions and excellent meat.  Check out their spices and other food stuff. Got couscous very cheap.
5,"I've ordered pizza and wings three times and the have consistently created perfection, seriously."
5,"I've been meaning to try this place for months and I'm so glad that the temperature has finally dropped to less than 100 degrees so I could take advantage of the outdoor patio for lunch! 

The service was kind of slow..not sure if it was on purpose so I won't knock any stars off for that cause the food was delicious! Got the chicken, goat cheese, bacon, apple, pesto foccacia and would def recommend it. Everything tasted really fresh! A perfect lunch spot :)"
5,"If I won the lottery and just wanted to spend a few hours a week working, it would have to be in this store.  One, because I would want to be there just to see all the THINGS all the time, and two, because I would be able to spend all my money there.  This place rocks.

This place has three buildings- the west one has pricier items, but the stuff is GORGEOUS (see previous lotto winning comment).  The east one has very reasonably priced items, contains seasonal trinkets and specialty food items.  The south building has kids stuff, pet items and clothing/purses as well as some home items.  It is the BEST place to find a gift for someone, or spend your overtime check on something nice for yourself. 

Want nice stationary?  A cute soup tureen?  A garden item? New collar for your dog? Fake fruit for your centerpiece?  Gorgeous picture frames?  Cute gauzy dress?  Hip handbags? Pretty bangles?  Antique key holders?  Whimsical signage? Artful platters?  Decorative bird cages?  Catch my drift?  They have EVERYTHING! :)"
5,"I love the story time program here! I started coming this summer after having a baby and wanting to get my toddler out of the house while beating the heat. The staff here is amazing! It is a 30 minute session of singing, dancing, stories and bubbles. We look forward to this every week now. My daughter loves the take home cut out and coloring sheet. The first thing she does is come home and color it. I am so thankful for this free program."
5,"I love the owners.  Very friendly and accomodating.  One night we had called after they had closed, and were pleasantly surprised when someone answered.  Turns out they were hosting a private party.  They agreed to take our order, which made us pretty happy.

I adore their Greek fries.  Olive oil, lemon, and the perfect amount of fetta.  Been here several times for lunch, and always leave happy.  Looking forward to meeting friends here for happy hour."
5,I was very impressed with the service and food. St Francis provided a delicious meal and beautiful ambiance that was just right for a group of clients after work.
5,"With our regular Indian place converted to buffet and my lunch companions refusing to go (don't tell them, but I would go anyway), it was time to find a new Indian spot for the work lunch rotation.  We were on a mission and I was trying to figure out whether Jewel would be added to the list of acceptable lunch haunts.  After managing a circuitous route to the top floor of a parking garage, we navigated a maze like structure of corridors to find the restaurant.  Travel time was starting to negate Jewel from the list.  The lunch menu was small, and we all ordered the thali meat combination.    After a modest wait time the food arrived in an array of metal containers and was delicious.  I hope we go back, but majority rules."
5,"Papago Park is a great place to ride (bicycles, that is).  The terrain can be as easy or as hard as you'd like-- just choose your trail!"
5,Tuck Shop is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phx. Everything is superb from the service to drinks to food to overall experience. Definitely go soon!
5,"We searched our phones for a place to go to have some Ceviche. This restaurant received some good reviews so we drove down from NE Phoenix and were a little skeptical on the location... but our concerns were immediately set at ease once we stepped inside. What a great little place with very friendly staff! We really appreciated the cleanliness too. We ordered the shrimp ceviche, shrimp in green sauce and shrimp and broccoli in cream sauce. Everything was outstanding! Even the simple rice and beans were absolutely delicious! And the tortillas,  uh-mazin!! Danielle was wonderful and we truly enjoyed her service. We will definitely come back and bring friends next time! Between the two of us, we already texted half our friends about this place and we haven't even finished eating yet! RECOMMENDED FOR SURE!!"
5,"My house is clean using pet-friendly products.  They arrive on time.  I know that some of the reviews talk about having trouble reaching them by phone, but I have never had a problem reaching them by email (which I prefer).  The ladies show up, work quickly and efficiently, and are on their way.  I couldn't be happier."
5,"Lived in house for 9 years and just thought was time to replace the carpeting, had used some of those ""$99 room"" services over the years for routine cleaning, met Ray Odom, Owner of Hydro-Pro, and gave them a crack at cleaning the carpets before I replaced them. I was Amazed at results, by the time they were done the carpets looked brand new, took their time and did incredibally throrugh job.  Great service at reasonable price-well worth it. My carpet cleaner from now on."
5,"This is the only auto repair place I've ever seen with 5 stars solid, and they totally deserve it.

My boyfriend has a 1969 Pontiac Firebird that hasn't run in several years. After sinking lots of his own time into tinkering with it and $1000 to the awful Meineke down the street, he gave up... until my car's transmission went for good, and he decided to fix the Bird (yeah!) so I could drive it (yes, I am super lucky!)

Whitey's diagnosed it as the carburetor dumping fuel (which is what Meineke charged $500 to replace.. hmmm...). Upon hearing the story of Meineke, Whitey's told him to order the part himself to avoid the markup and they'd put it in for just labor.  Awesome!

We took it home, but it wasn't running quite right still, and then failed emissions. Back to the shop it went.

Whitey's took it back, spent ALL WEEKEND on it doing various minor things. At one point, they called and said ""We've done this, this and this, and it's still not quite right, so we're gonna keep it another day.""   I was glad they were admitting they actually felt it to be not right and were determined to fix it, versus just handing it back again... but I was dreading the repair bill.

We picked it up Tuesday. The bill? $7. That's right - SEVEN DOLLARS. They only charged him for a spark plug and oil filter. That is amazing to me - I was expecting several hundred dollars for their time.  

The car runs beautifully now, and they were extremely pleasant the entire time. I'm taking my alleged defunct car to them for a second opinion next week. I HIGHLY recommend Whitey's!"
5,Everything you need to feel like you opened a time capsule!  Place makes me want to have 5 houses to slather in vintage odds and ends.  The place is very well organized and themed which makes it easy to find items while you're on the hunt.
5,"Fantastic Happy Hour 3-6pm! Half price appetizers and good drink prices. I like their Sushi and Garlic Noodles.

And pretty much everything I've had there is good. I had a Peppercorn Steak about 2 weeks ago and it was amazing. It's right next to the movies so it's a good place to meetup too."
5,"This place is one of my favorite burger joints.  If you really appreciate a good burger, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Kobe burger, Double truffle fries, Creme Brulee Shake and just pure joy.  First time, the burger was slightly over cooked for medium rare; but ever since I have been back multiple times and it's been prepared perfectly to my expectations.  I do believe in second chances and they won me over.  I don't get the mushroom on the Kobe; Meat is very tasty and flavorful, no need to add any toppings.  The Samburger and Zinburger are very tasty as well.  Last time I added bacon to the Zinburger, very good, and I do recommend that.  The staff are very attentive to diners needs.  I have tried a few of the Fox-RC and every time has been an excellent experience so far.  (I hope it won't change).  SF definitely has a unique and entrepreneurial vision in food industry which has, and will make him very successful."
5,"Exactly what a hole in the wall Pho place should be like! Totally reminds me of LA, SF or any authentic Pho place in any multi-cultural city. Congrats Phoenix for not being completely white bred and redneck- must give thanks to center city.

Anyhow, portions are large, ingredients taste fresh and prices are inexpensive. If you're one of the sheltered folk out here that gets freaked out by rude bums or the lack of decor- stay in the shelter of your HOA tract home or go to the mall."
5,"I have taken acting classes from Verve Studios on and off for four years, and have recently returned for another work out!

Amanda is a true professional,  a working Actor herself,and gets the actor to be real, not ""act"".  Do not miss this opportunity to learn and grow, AND have fun.

5,"This is a great little hidden gem! From the outside, it looks like just a dive but the inside is surprisingly nice. 

The food here is great and they are willing to make things to your taste when it comes to ingredients and spice level. 

The waitstaff are also very friendly. They came by while we were eating just to make sure we were happy with everything even though this is an ""order at the counter"" place.

Another little bonus is that they have a drink station where guests can help themselves to free refills which definitely comes in handy in Phoenix!"
5,"Love love love this place.  Tasty with great prices... who can beat that?  My newest thing is to order a gyro-to-go and enjoy it at home.  I'm a mom now so eating at a restaurant is a lot harder than it used to be. haha

See ya there!"
5,"As an artist, I've come to be very picky about the stores from which I purchase my art supplies. Arizona Art Supply is a GREAT store!!! Every time I visit I overhear the staff's experienced recommendations; they take the time to ensure that every customer's needs are satisfied. 

I am always immediately welcomed as I delve into the fully stocked and well-organized aisles. Yes, this is my kind of art supply store!  As I browse the expansive selection of everything from  drawing supplies to paint, easels and canvases to ceramic tools, an overwheming desire to create comes over me. AZ Art Supply has a HUGE selection of my favorite brands--Prismacolor and Golden Paints!  

Although this store is smaller, the prices are reasonable--they beat out Michael's prices for nearly every item. If you're looking for exceptional quality, a diverse selection and a knowledgeable staff, Arizona Art Supply is your best bet."
5,"Pizza Venice has, hands down, the best pizza in the Valley. In my mind, they've got the best bang for your buck with the XL three-topping pizza deal. Get that with the garlic crust, and you're buying pizza nirvana. It doesn't hurt that the owners are incredibly friendly. Why would I even consider ordering terrible chain pizza when I can get a great pizza for a great price from a locally owned business?"
5,I read about Scramble on line so I thought I would go there for brunch and I loved it!! The Santa Fe eggs Benedict are amazing! The staff is friendly and the ambiance is incredible. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!!!
5,"I have not been bowling in 24 years,so you can imagine i was worried. But, this place is clean and fresh. On certain nights,(Monday)and a few others you pay a $5.00 cover charge,then everything is $1.00 .Food ,drinks , games and most important bowling games. The instructions were easy. We got shoes in our size then went and picked out a ball. Lots to choose from! Lots of fun!!!   It was a $20.00 night for 2 of us. The workers are very helpful and Friendly. Bathrooms were also clean. I did not see them spray the shoes with Lysol so that was a little gross.But, other than that it was a great time."
5,"Simply magnificent. Easily the best Mexican food I've had the pleasure of enjoying in the States. I can't stop thinking about the carne asada Torta. The rice and beans are the best I've eaten. Tacos are simple and delicious. The most exciting part about it is that I get to go back and try the famed Bombero Burrito and other, more ""exotic"" things like the lengua and menudo!

You must go!"
5,LOVE the food!!!!
5,"Had lunch here with my wife today. It's the second time I've been and her first. After my first visit it rocketed into my top five favourite restaurants of all time. They have some top notch food, and the best thing is that it's such a deliciously welcome change from the bottom-feeder's Mexican crap that you see all over Phoenix. The menu is varied and I think I eventually will want to try everything. Appetizers include fried alligator and frog's legs. The main I had today was their Mardi Gras Pasta, which is linguini with tomato, thin-sliced garlic, andouille sausage, crawfish meat, onion and delicious shrimp topped with a really nice creamy sauce. Absolutely delicious. The wife had mahi-mahi with an even NICER sauce, and dirty rice on the side. Although a tiny bit on the pricy side it's definitely worth coming back to. Large open seating (outdoor seating also available), dimly lit, old-style jazz, a large full-service bar and a very quaint outside waiting area with water feature, giant fans etc. The service was also great and both times I've been, the waiters have been very helpful (the first guy told me that if I got the large serving of alligator, to try it 'half-blackened' - a great tip which allowed me to taste both 'styles' of the appetizer). They also have things I've not heard of before like etoufee and opelousas. If my dad didn't live over seven thousand miles away I'd take him here in an instant - he'd absolutely love the place. You will too.

Oh yeah, they have creme brulee (with fresh fruit) and sweet potato pecan pie, amongst other things, for dessert. We had the latter - yum."
5,"Wow... i don't think I've ever been in a more narrow place.. ever! 

but it was just perfect in ever way!!! 

They have tables along one side and a bar with tall stools along the other side... you can watch them make your food.... 
its like the food network... but live and you can smell it :) 

my coworker and i sat right in front of the oven... every time they would open the oven i would only get hungrier!! :) we could see all the fresh and yummy ingredients!! 

i had the Reuben (Pastrami, corned beef, homemade sauerkraut and Swiss with a side of 1000 island dressing) 

WOW... it was amazing... for their sauerkraut they use red cabbage... it was more sweet than bitter... and the crust of the pasty was flaky and buttery... so delicious!! and i honestly forgot how much i love corned beef! over all it was very rich... but great to share.... 

My Coworker had the Italian.. (pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil, tomatoes and marinara sauce) it looked great... he loved it... you could see the fresh basil and tomatoes... it smelled divine 

we didn't speak for a full 20 minutes... just barley loud enough mmmmmmmms and o-m-g this is amazing... said quietly to ourselves.... 

all of the employees were so outgoing and laid back at the same time... just really cool guys... i loved the atmosphere and the attitudes that filled this place... 

i cannot wait to come back!"
5,Cary is one of the most honest and knowledgeable mechanics I've ever been to. He is caring to all of his customer's and his shop takes the utmost care with the cars they work on. I cannot recommend him strongly enough!
5,"Lately I have been addicted to a good Caprese style sandwich and Pane Bianco's is AWESOME!  I read the previous reviews so I went there expecting a crowd and nowhere to sit.  This did not detract from the experience for me because the quality and freshness of the food was more than enough to get and keep my attention.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, being from the Atlantic Northeast I have high expectations when it comes to Italian done well with personality to boot. I did not want to wait till I got home to eat my so good smelling prize so I went outside to find picnic style tables and benches.  It was way to hot to sit outside and I was craving iced coffee so I went next door to Lux and was both surprised and relieved to find many of their patrons with Pane Bianco bags openly eating their lunches with drinks from Lux to claim patronage.  Can't wait for a hopefully air-conditioned expansion."
5,"As many other people have said in other reviews, Betito's is similar to Filibertos.  However, I thought Betitos tasted a little better.  The food was less greasy than Filibertos.  My family had Carne asada burrito, carnitas burrito, a chicken chimichanga, and the super nachos.  They all tasted excellent.  My favorite was the carnitas burrito.  Now, Betitos offers one dollar tacos on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.  I haven't tried their tacos yet, but I intend to try them in the future."
5,"Mojo's was my favorite till I tried Menchies..much better flavors like Chocolate Covered Banana and even Pumpkin (awesome) for their seasonal!  Lots of flavor, very rich, clean & priced at about what they charge at mojos..maybe a little more but Im not sure!"
5,"Have you ever walked into a bar or restaurant and instantly felt at home?  That's how I felt when I walked into the Grind last night.  The place has a great vibe, fantastic food and cocktails, and a friendly staff.  Some of the highlights of what we ate last night...  The burgers are phenomenal, the cable car drink was unusual and tasty, how could you not love donuts, and the bacon... oh the bacon...  I highly recommend swinging in for lunch or dinner so it become one of your favorites as it is now one of mine."
5,"These dentists are great at explaining medical issues in a way that you can understand. They are honest and very smart. They don't take my insurance and I still go there (lets face it, dental insurance doesn't reimburse much, so it's only like a $15 difference for me to go out of network for a cleaning). I would never go anywhere else!"
5,"Their food was GREAT! I had the pancit, lumpia, and that purple rice! The price was not bad for the amount of food that they gave you!

Even though they had a very long line they were still very fast with service!"
5,"RIP AZ Coffee Connection.  :(  I stopped by two days ago unaware that they had closed.  I am severely bummed.  This place is irreplaceable!  Damn you, Starbucks and McDonalds!"
5,"This is hands down the best place for bagels...
but more importantly... after all my travels it has the BEST Bialy ever.
I just wish they would open on in Greenville.
Oh it is soooo good, a poppy seed bialy toasted with cream cheese...
I guess I can only hope they are always open when I visit Scottsdale...
.n"
5,"This is one of my favorite little gems in Phoenix. I've never had better pho than here. I usually order the ""spicy beef sate"" pho, which is miles above the rare beef pho. My family and I also order the pork ""spicy treats"" which is a roll-your-own spring roll. It's delicious and fun! One order feeds all five of us. 

The owner is also extremely nice. They also offer discounts to ASU students! Have to love that."
5,"Honestly, this is the best pizza that I've had in Arizona.  I'm a sucker for wood-fired goodness and fresh mozzarella--Cibo does both to perfection.  Additionally, I've come to appreciate the character and charm possessed by this little gem in a sea of chains and strip malls.    The wine list is not overly extensive, just efficient and thorough like it should be.  The salad selection is full of variety and offers a bright way to begin their dining experience.  Be warned:  Cibo is pretty tiny, causing a wait on weekends."
5,"Tried the Restaurant Week special, and chose the Stetson chopped salad, mixed mushrooms with polenta, and bread pudding.  The Stetson chopped was amazing.  The preparation is beautiful when they bring it out, and then the taste is the perfect mix of sweet, savory, crunchy, soft once the salad is mixed up.  I tried some of the testosterone salad, which was decent, and filled with a lot of well prepared beef, but it didn't quite compare to the chopped salad.  

Just as a general side note, if you choose the restaurant week menu and have the chopped salad and then the mushrooms, I think the flavor of the chopped salad is more bold than the mushrooms, so the mushrooms will taste bland to you.  This happened to me as I transitioned from the salad to main dish, but when I took the mushrooms home in a to go box and ate them later, the more delicate flavor showed through and I appreciated it a lot more.  

The bread pudding was amazing.  Perfectly moist, with lots of flavor, and not too sweet.  

Service was excellent (Thanks Owen!), and along with the extensive selection of wines, they also have some more unique beers such as lambic, as well as a nice selection of non alcoholic sodas (The cream soda is locally made and very tasty!)"
5,Tried going there for my 1st visit and they were closed during hours they were supposed to be open.  Have tried calling them a few times during normal business hours and did not get anyone to pickup.  They may be closed for good.  Not sure.
5,We went today after lunch. I got my usual of lime basil and real mint chip (which I love for the real mint leaves) and my hubby got chocolate guiness and four peaks hop knot. Best ice cream in Phoenix! The staff is always super nice. They give us ice bags to take our ice cream home :-)  Love this place
5,"Super cool, cookie/cake.chocolate maker haven!  :)  Totally worth the 40 minute drive I had - it was packed when I got there and I did not experience one little bit of rudeness.  I arrived with my 5yo and after cruising the aisles for a bit an employee came by to see if I needed help finding anything.  Super neat place!  :)"

Double Double Animal Style.

It is worth the trip cross country.  Well maybe not, but I do enjoy them while I am visiting.  I cannot get enough of them.

The private stalled restrooms are always spotless and stocked.  4 Flushes."
5,"Obsessed. Like, I've-got-the-Twangy-Tart-withdrawal-shakes level of addiction to this place. Please make one in Arcadia! Pleeeaaassse."
5,So my friend and I stumbled upon this place on our way to Barb's bakery but WOW I have never had a better taco in my life. The carne asada street tacos are freaking amazing. They also have the bottled cokes from mexico that for some reason taste sweeter than cokes bottled here. The waitress was also extremely friendly when we were checking out we asked how to pronounce the name of the restaurant and she started teaching us some Spanish.
5,Nobuo shows his unique talents with everything on the menu. Carefully crafted features with much to drink. Start with the pork belly buns and a stout. Then go on until you can no longer.
5,"Why oh why can't there be one of these closer to my house?! I would take them any day over Subway. Their bread is fresh, their meat and cheese is sliced perfectly thin. This may sound strange too, but every Mr. Goodcents I've been too has the BEST soda fountain Coke. Okay...I said it. Judge me. 

I do prefer the Mr. Goodcents over in Tempe off of 48th Street, but this one is just as good."
5,A yummy Mexican Sunnyslope dive.  The oatmeal horchata is tasty!  THE torta is really an experience!
5,"The food was flavorful and plenty of it. Eating with only your fingers is quite fun - make your momma proud. My girlfriend won the best dish of the night - lentils and chicken and cabage/carrots. It all had kind of sweetish/bitterish/spicy flavor. I had the lamb and jalapeño dish, which was kind of greasy. You eat with your fingers and can scoop up the food with the bread they give you - a tartish type crepe, which goes well with the food. I'd be happy to go back and try something different.  If you are used to frozen pizzas and Burger King, you might want to stick with that as this experience might bit be as enjoyable as those who are more open to what they consume."
5,"Vitality Health and Fitness is a small gym that offers personal fitness, group fitness and fitness classes. The classes and the training programs are all varied, challenging, unique and fun. The members are positive, full of smiles and easy-going. The gym is not intimidating at all, the trainers are kind and build programs that suit your personal fitness levels, and the cost is VERY reasonable.  

My husband and I have been working out with Megan, and she's a doll.  We haven't gone for very long so we'll keep you posted on the impending RESULTS!

Vitality also offers nutrition and massage -- which we both plan on checking out!  The owner is delightful and easy to work with. If you have any questions or concerns about your costs or the way you are being treated, she works WITH you to ensure you are getting the level of service that you expect and that the club/program can provide. The owner is honest and respectful, fair and reasonable. I think everyone should contact this club and see if it might work for them - you won't be disappointed!"
5,"We just sold the car we bought at Carmax that spawned the original review here almost three years ago.

As with the purchase, the sale was ridiculously simple. The appraisal took about 20 minutes, and came in ABOVE Kelley Blue Book ""excellent condition"" trade in value -- and the car was in good - very good condition, but certainly not excellent.

A fair price, and no hassle. At a car dealership. Who'd have thunk it?"
5,"I first visited this restaurant after my friend pushed me to visit the Hawaiian festival at the Tempe Town Lake a few months ago.

""Big deal,"" I thought. ""How can a Hawaiian festival be fun?""

Well, the food was amazing. And after having half a rotisserie chicken, I was craving for more.

A few days later, I finally began my search for the perfect (or near perfect) Hawaiian restaurant, in which I can satisfy my Hawaiian cravings.

My first stop was Mai Island Grill, located in/near the Arizona State University campus. Parking was a bit of a challenge; this is especially true during the lunch hour.

When I finally found a parking spot, I went in and ordered. I had the short ribs plate. The plates include one scoop of macaroni salad and steamed rice.

After placing my order for the short ribs, I ordered the Spam musubi.

The guy preparing food replied with a laugh.

""Is it good?"" I asked

Jay -- the man who operates this restaurant -- replied, ""Yes it's good."" 

Then he said something about how the guy who laughs never laughs (or something like that).

About 10 minutes later, my food was ready.

The food was fantastic; just what I was looking for!

The prices are very reasonable. Plates are about $10 and less.

I also suggest that you try the fish, beef, grilled chicken, and pork katsu.

And finally, I hope that this place continues to provide the same liberal portions. Also, I think it would be cool if Mai Island Grill began serving two scoops of macaroni salad and two scoops of rice (just a fantasy of mine).

Additional Notes:

- Cash Only.

- Opens late in the morning and closes early in the afternoon (call for exact hours).

- There never seems to be any ""Lumpia!"" :-/"
5,"OK: call me 'weird' here: but; I liked the funky (very) Old School ambiance of MacAlpines when my fiance and I went there this past Sunday for the Studebaker and friends car show.

Admittedly; I was there once before ca. 1999 and was NOT impressed but things have def improved IMHO.

I had a Club sandwich and it was one of the best ones I've ever had, at least in recent years. Would eat one again. The chocolate milk shake was OK but could have used a tad more syrup but, I'd have one again."
5,"Everytime I think of Chodang my mouth waters. I love the spicy tofu soup they serve here along with their korean style dumplings. Their portions are just right. If you don't like spicy foods you can tell them to not make it spicy. I also love the condiments they serve before the meal. Love it!

I like their decor. The tables and walls really go together and you definitely feel like you're at an asian restaurant. Everything is neat and clean (even the bathrooms)."
5,I try and eat here regularly. Hummus is great. Very personable staff. And the atmosphere is awesome. Look forward to the next time!
5,"I'd give it about a 4.5, but I like rounding up for local businesses!  The owner has been in there every time I've shown up, and the food comes out hot.  The prices are spot on what you'd expect to pay, and so is the quality.  I'm not from Chicago, and have only been there a couple times, so I wouldn't be able to speak to its authenticity - but I can speak to its taste and the great customer service the crew provides every time.  If you're in the neighborhood and thinking about a hot dog, burger, fried zuccini, italian beef sandwich, or chicken burger, skip Sonic and DQ - they can't touch this place with a 15-yard drive-thru window."
5,Postino's in Gilbert was stunning! Amazing outdoor/indoor chic atmosphere.  Food and wine were excellent as expected! What another great addition to the Postino family! Loved it!!!!!
5,Great place for brunch or to relax with a coffee. Their hot chocolate is amazing.
5,"Family friendly and we love the soups and salads.  Mushroom soup is our favorite!!!!  We also enjoy their veggie sandwich but all of them that we have tried are delicious.  Sunday brunch is great too.  We do frittatas or banana pancakes, yum.  Or a simple Wildflower capaccino and scone does the trick.  We'be been going for years and will continue to go.  Oh, did I mention the free WiFi?  Great for some business lunches."
5,"I have been frequenting this spot since they opened and have always said they were better than Starbucks but Iam in a special kind of heaven after the change in menu and addition of pressed tea lattes!!! Yum, yum, yum!!! Far better than Starbucks powdered green tea latte and roughly a dollar cheaper than the high priced cup there as well. The early morning staff is great and free WiFi is an added bonus. I can honestly say for the New Year, I'm quitting you Starbucks......and mean it."
5,"The management thanked me profusely for my input on Yelp and graciously invited me to return as a guest to show me the true Latilla Experience. I was told changes have been made because of reading my YELP review.The changes are that dinner portions are more ample than before, the appetizer plate share charge is gone now and I noticed the web site has been updated. This visit showed little resemblance to the service I had last time. A full staff was on with staff working in sync as a team with all the tables not just mine.

I was even more blown away with the food than the last time due to perhaps I picked foods that were more suiting to me some highs were-

Beet salad- it was similar to others I had in other places but this one also had HOUSE GROWN BEETS ,Riesling soaked pears and the toasted hazelnuts made the salad  pop with flavor. 

Foraged mushroom rissotto-correctally made with a depth of flavor, it was good on it's own but this had an added embellishment of a SIXTY TWO DEGREE duck egg. 

Nicely seasoned and prepared fresh branzino sat on top of ribbon cut caponata, an unusual surprise was the vinaigrette and the ribbon cut string less celery that was very good. 

We also enjoyed the Kobe Flap steak with wine reduction and tiny marble size multi color potatoes and tasty spinach.

Since we skipped the interesting desserts last time we had to try one this time and tried the chocolate hazelnut cake with jam-figs and mascarpone gelato this dessert was garnished with a chocolate sort of lavender crisp and roasted hazelnuts. This dessert was something Iron chef worthy for sure with all the flavors working well together.

The service we had was phenomenal.

The food at Latilla is masterfully done, the surroundings are majestic and breathtaking. The meal we had wasn't ordinary it was extraordinary!"
5,"Wood fired pizzas, scrumptious pasta dishes and bacon wrapped shrimp.  How can you go wrong with a place that wraps things in bacon.  C'mon, even  veggies admit that things wrapped in bacon are good!  Has a smokey atmosphere and a slight bar crowd but the food is outstanding."
5,"Hands down the best middle eastern restaurant in the Tempe area.  You can't beat the prices, everything is always consistently good (we go here about once a week).

Favorites: 
Hummus and Gyro Delux!

Don't forget to grab some baklava too, this is the best i've ever had (and that includes having some while in the middle east)"
5,"They finally just opened a Rita's location in Surprise!! I think it just opened yesterday or today, but it's just as good as the one on Union Hills and 83rd Avenue.  I told my co-workers about it and we basically have been driving by during our lunch break just waiting for it to open over the past few months.
It's hard to explain the texture of the ice. It's thicker than the ice in a frozen margarita, yet it's not crunchy or unrefined like an Icee drink. Sonic has similar ice, but I feel like it's just not as good as Rita's. I guess that's why it's Italian ice. It's in its own category!

There are 3 main types: Gelati's (custard-ice-custard), Blendini's (custard-ice-custard with mix ins like Oreos, M&Ms, etc), and Mistos (ice-custard drink). You can also get just regular custard alone or flavored ice alone. One of their most famous ice flavors is Swedish Fish. There's also a sugar substitute version of their ice and today's sugar free ice flavor was Pineapple. I tried a Red Velvet Cake Gelati today with vanilla custard and it was nothing less than amazing!
The menu is a little confusing since there are so many choices. There are mainly only 2 types of custards though, vanilla and chocolate, that can be mixed with the 12 flavors of ice that consistently change. 
Before, I was solely a fan of ice cream and yogurt. Now, I am grateful that my sister-in-law dragged me here, because there is nothing quite like it yet! Now I will always compare Italian ices to this place."
5,"theres a gun check upon entry.

i often forget AZ is quite different than CA....

my first and only experience at cabela's was on black friday. i honestly havent participated in black friday much in past yrs and questioned deals really being deals. but HELLO deals at cabela's.

first of all, they gave away rifles to the first 800 people we were there on black friday. again, im not in cali anymore! this place is an outdoors lover dream. and on top of selection and discounted prices...its almost like an amusement park: 

aquarium room with freshwater fish, back natural history museum-eque taxidermy displays, heads of animals and maps of where they originate from hanging throughout the huge main room, a chocolate shop, and entire cafeteria. 

basically, you can make a day out of cabela's. we were there for 4 hours and i didn't even realize.

but now lets talk about the deals....the deeeeaaallssss.

also, single ladies...id say 80% of the customers in this place are always male so... ;)"
5,"Vintage sodas sold by bottle, all of your grandmother's favorite childhood candy, an abundance of gag gifts and novelty items... you just can't dislike this place. Each time I'm in, I spend a good hour just perusing the countless Fred & Friends products and debating whether or not I should buy the stick-on-mustaches or 10 of the Chinese finger traps. 

But, let's be honest here. I mostly go for the photo booth. By far the best photo booth in town... good quality pictures (not cheap like the ones inside the mall) and they have little masks, glasses, and mustaches-on-a-stick you can use in case you're tired of flashing the peace sign or making that horrendous duck face.

Soda. Candy. Toys. Photo booth. Don't kid yourself. You're never too old for that ish."
5,"The staff is friendly and knowledgable and the sales on stationary are always welcome.  Lots of specialty papers to purchase by the sheet or in packs of 25 or 50, with matching envelopes.  Oh so easy to give just the right touch to my correspondance.

Even when they are swamped with business the staff is always ready to lend a hand or help with a jammed machine.

When my puter is down I rent one of theirs for just $10 and hour with printing priveleges."
5,"OK, being from Wisconsin (the land of the ""great lakes"") I was COMPLETELY surprised to be told that, yes, there are lakes here in the desert of Arizona.  The Lake, Saguaro Lake, is a man made lake originally built as Stewart Mountain Dam...even so, its beauty is equal to those you would see in the glacier regions of the Midwest.  I was amazed, frankly, at how beautiful this tour was.  Sold for $18 for 90 minutes, you get your money's worth.  But that is probably not what you want to hear...

The ""event"" is a combination of 1) the scenery, and also 2) the charm of the paddle boat itself.  The boat is quite large with seating for probably close to 75 people!  It's an event that you could share with family, but I happened to be there with friends.  Currently, it's a pretty mellow type of event (great for Mother's Day!), although I am told that they are hoping to exploit its benefits to include comedy shows, Jazz ensembles, stargazing, and a variety of other events.

P.S.  They also advertise that you can rent the paddle boat for company picnics, weddings, and the like."
5,"Once you buy a steak from von hansons, you will never buy steak anywhere else again.  This is the best butcher shop I have ever seen.  Also great sausages, chicken, cuts of lamb. I also get my thanksgiving turkey here."
5,"Absolutely beautiful grounds. Golf course, restaurants, shops, botanical gardens, tennis courts...it's all beautiful. Definitely book a room here as opposed to the main section of the hotel - I'm not exactly sure what the difference is, but it IS a different (and smaller) building.

Our room itself was nice, but the view was what made it amazing. From the balcony, you can see the golf course, the mountain, desert views, cactus...everything. And the service was great.

The only complaint is that when I booked my stay, I was told that each guest would be assigned an ""Ambassador"" who would help ensure a great stay, or whatever. But throughout my weekend, this supposed Ambassador was never mentioned and didn't show up. Not a big deal, but if you're going to promise that service, then you better deliver.

Otherwise, great stay. I would highly recommend this hotel. Great for a relaxing weekend."
5,"This little taco shop gets 5+ stars! 

The fish tacos were out of this world, breaded and fried to perfection. I also tried the al pastor taco that was marinated well and you can taste the marinade in every bite. I also tried molotes for the first time. The cilantro salsa and red salsa was homemade and oh so good and spicy. The quesadillas are like cheese crisps. I am so disappointed that I did not find this place earlier since it's so close to home. 

I have to try the other items in their menu soon. Price is very reasonable as their tacos range from $1-$1.50."
5,"Very authentic, excellent Thai food and soothing ambience. And they have delivery! My favorites are the Fried Shrimp Rolls, Egg Rolls, Clear Noodle Soup, Pad Thai Chicken, Phad-See-Ew Beef, Papaya Salad, etc.. I love the Sweet Rice with Thai Custard. It tastes exactly like the Filipino custard I grew up with."
5,"This is a great little authentic Mexican restaurant - don't let the looks fool you, it is delicious!  I had the Tampiquena, it is one of the best I have had.  Highly recommended"
5,I have been to slippery pig a half a dozen times in the last few months since moving in nearby. I have nothing but great things to say about the shop. They are friendly and courteous and I haven't experienced any of that bike snobbery that comes with LBS. I am glad I found a local shop with great service
5,"I thought this place was outstanding! The staff was awesome, the food was excellent, overall appearance of restaurant was nice!"
5,Loved my haircut. Walked in and waited for just a minute. The stylist cut exactly like I wanted and I walked out paying 20 which included the tip.
5,"I dined here last week with my wife and in-laws and, I gotta say, it doesn't get much better.  Ambiance was dark but classy.  Loved the music (no dated Rat Pack stuff here).  Started the evening with their amazing Trio of Duck Fat Fries.  The truffle emulsion may have been the best sauce I've ever had in my life!  Only got better from there: Shellfish tower was loaded with goodies and all tasted straight from the ocean!  For entrees, my wife got the Trio of Kobe Beef and I had the Fried Chicken for two.  One of the top meals I've ever had in my life.  The chicken was so moist an came with a truffle mac & cheese and onion jus.  I did say it was for two but it was so good that i refused to share.  My wife couldn't stop talking about the Kobe Trio.  

But, I gotta say, the best part of the experience was the staff.  Knowledgeable just isn't enough to describe the service here.  They care about every single detail, never missing one.  The Sommelier made excellent wine recommendations (and each one well within my price range) and never skipped a beat when it came to pouring for the table.  The server was as professional as professional gets and the Manager seemed to always be there to pull out a chair or provide a fresh napkin.  Flawless.

Well done Bourbon Steak!"
5,"Just did take out.  Great experience.  Easy to place my order over the phone, friendly service.  Nice that they have special pick up parking spots and entrance.  Made it an in and out operation.  Ordered the gluten free pizza with pepperoni and sausage.  My husband and son loved it and have already been asking to get it again.  I had the spaghetti calzone and was in HEAVEN.  I highly recommend it."
5,"What an exciting time.  I am writing my first YELP review about the wonderful MOJO Yogurt  I visited yesterday afternoon.   There were so many wonderful flavors to choose from and the people there were nice enough to pass out tiny little sample cups.  It was a challenge narrowing down my selections to a few flavors but I somehow managed.  I ended up with Birthday Cake (that's right, there is Birthday Cake flavored yogurt, life IS good), Cafe Latte, and the divine Original Tart.  After throwing on a few gummy bears I was a happy girl.  I see in other reviews that some complained about pricing but I am willing to pay a little extra for quality and happiness."
5,"Sprouts is my favorite market to shop at! They are a great company who have a very friendly staff in their stores as well as their corporate office. They are also very involved with the community and with local farmers and businesses!

The prices for all the fresh and natural groceries they carry are the most reasonable out of all the grocery stores I have been too! The Vitamin Department has everything you could ever look for to help your well being and they are always extravaganzas in the stores so you are always getting the most out of your money, and in times like these I know people are very appreciative of that since groceries are becoming more and more expensive everyday, or so it seems!

I most definitely recommend anyone to shop at Sprouts!"
5,"Very friendly staff, cute decor! Small, but don't let that fool you, best sandwiches ever!! The egg salad sandwich was so good, it reminded me of the egg salad I enjoyed as a kid! Their potato salad is made there and soo yummy!! Talked to the owner and she was very nice."
5,"This place is a dream.  Designer blouses for $17.00.  Seven jeans and Hudson jeans for $20.  Steve Madden shoes for $25.  I could go on... the store is beautiful, well-organized and full of things that are in perfect or near-perfect condition.  Some items are still quite pricey, but most of the store is extremely reasonably priced.  

If you need something new very quickly for a date or an interview or a special occasion, you will probably find it here.  The employees are nice, friendly, helpful and the dressing rooms are good as well.  Love it!"
5,"Good reviews are easy to write. Stop reading this and just go eat there! 

OK, well I have visited this place for years now and don't go anywhere else if I am in this area. 

I like the Chef's, they are friendly and quick. They speak pretty good Spanish to me and but I don't dare try to respond in Japanese, ha ha. 

The value is phenomenal, where can two people get miso soup, salad, beans, tea, ice cream and sushi rolls all for under $20? 

I've tried the same at Say Sushi in my hometown of Maricopa and can't do it for under $40 or more for two. 

All you can eat is available but I find that ordering individually is more economical. 

Great atmosphere for a quick lunch or a large party for dinner. 

The waitresses are Asian and I find that suitable for the restaurant. Some reviews on here complain about them. I don't have any issue with them they have always treated me nice and done their job well. 

I will keep coming back."
5,Most amazing service! The food is common pho and buns but the main attraction is what drew me in it's not your typical Vietnamese restaurant it's a SPRING ROLL BAR!! Fantastic drinks! Great addition
5,"Still 5 stars, but sadly Amber is closing up shop.  Don't feel bad for her as it is not for the lack of business.  She is getting married and leaving the state and taking Spoken with her.  Damn her!!!  I did pick up some jeans and 3 shirts, all at 60% off.  So hurry over and pick up some bargains!  And wish Amber good luck!"
5,"I found Cake Frenzy through an service listing on Craigslist while looking for someone to create our wedding cake/cupcakes. Not only were we on a tight budget we only had about 2 1/2 months to plan for the venue we wanted only had a few dates available. I met Jennifer about a month prior, my fiance' and I knew we wanted a peanut butter & jelly cake and she happily obliged. I emailed her a picture of what I wanted and the day of our wedding when I first saw our cake I almost cried. She went above and beyond my expectations. The cake was beautiful with sugar flowers and gelatin butterflies. All of our guests loved the flavor combinations and the decorations. I highly recommend Cake Frenzy, she is professional, she takes pride in her work and extremely reasonable."
5,"I violated my rule of avoiding grocery shopping while hungry and decided to venture over to Whole Foods.  Whole Foods tends to be the indecisive individual's nightmare (that would be me).  Yet, this store is a foodie's dream. 

There are aisles upon aisles of glorious, wholesome products (pun intended).  Everything is meticulously organized and there are at least ten varieties of every type of item.  No joke.  It took me fifteen minutes to decide which brand of bottled tea would be suitable (and economical). 

I roamed the freshly prepared food section like a vulture circling it's prey...strategizing which choice would be the best taste sensation.  Did I want a made-to-order wrap?  Or a glass of wine and a couple tapas? (the live music was alluring)...Maybe sushi?  Pizza?  Salad bar?  Soup? Maybe something from the smokehouse...oooh! A cupcake from the cupcake bar? 

On and on it went. 

My final decision was sushi. The spicy tuna roll tasted fresh, and the Pacific salad roll was very crisp. I also grabbed a container of ginger for $1.99--not the artificially preserved pink variety--all-natural pickled ginger.  Bliss.  I purchased some cucumber salad from the salad bar as a side/palate cleanser. All in all, a very satisfying meal. 

Prices are a tad higher than your average grocery store. Then again, it is Whole Foods. A word of advise:  come with a game plan (e.g. a shopping list). If you don't define what it is you want prior to entering this store, you'll end up spending two hours and twice as much money than you anticipated."
5,Two other AC companies were going to charge me double for the same fix.  Accutemp has a new customer for life!  Highly recommend!
5,"still a big fan, wonderful pizza!!!
-- Remember to join their birthday club!!!-"
5,"Yen has amazing sushi. I would say that they have the best sushi in AZ. You have to try it to see how amazing it is. The service is great and I feel like I just stepped into Japan. The whole sushi experience is very authentic and perfect place to hang out with friends or take a date :D

There is only one thing I don't like. Sometimes it get's to busy so make sure to get there early (around 7 P.M) if you want to be seated right away."
5,"We just tried this out this afternoon following lunch at Pita Jungle next door.   It's a self-service yogurt shop where you pay by the ounce once you've finished your creation.  

The offerings included the standard vanilla and chocolate, but also less traditional offerings like Irish Mint and Red Velvet were also available.  They offer a taste of any of the products, and you can mix multiple types of yogurts in your container.  They also offer a variety of standard yogurt shop toppings for your creation.

I had a combination of the Irish Mint and Latte yogurts, with a couple of toppings.  The yogurt itself was smooth, creamy and well flavored.

We'll likely be dropping by here in the future."
5,"I've been going here for 10 years. My relationship began when I needed a bunch of clothes tailored for my first trip to Europe. I needed everything quickly and was very specific. She got everything done in time for my trip. 

Over the years I've brought dozens of clothes. She's done everything from changing a dress into a top to adding bra pads to a cocktail dress. She's hemmed and taken in. She's shortened straps and helped me change out fabric in clothing to create a completely different look. I can communicate anything I want and she'll have it done exactly the way I envisioned it. We've been able to change things so much we sometimes recreate new looks. 

Her prices are a little high but well worth the quality. Every single person I've recommended has been extremely pleased with her work."
5,"Hands down, best slices in Scottsdale...."
5,"We recently took a weekend getaway to Phoenix and stayed here. The Hotel is beautiful and our rooms were spacious and very comfortable. The staff here are topnotch. I love the lobby wine & hot apple cider hour in the afternoons, and the lobby coffee & hot chocolate bars in the mornings. We had access to the Golds Gym across from the hotel and were able to get a good workout in their cardio theatre. There is an outdoor skating rink right outside and a small shopping/dining area. It is located right across from the stadium and could walk to our event. I would definitely recommend staying here, especially if you are attending an event at the arena."
5,"Delightful experience! I came in with my 2 little ones alone. Jay was our waiter, and a very good one. He got the chefs to prepare their sunsine roll with orange and passionfruit dressing, because I am highly allergic to mango. He was very accomodating. I also had the seared tuna tataki, which was also excellent. My kids had miso soup and their fried rice; both were very good. I was very surprised that a strip mall sushi joint would be thay delicious. Thumbs up!!"
5,"This has to be the best Thai food around. I have tried a few other places, but none are as authentic and delicious as Swaddee. We are now regulars and have never been disappointed."
5,"Spotted Donkey Cantina is amazing!  They have delicious Mexican food, and fantastic margaritas to wash everything down with. You do have to pay for chips and salsa here, so there probably won't be any of that four bowl snacking before your main entree's come, but the medley of salsa's it comes with make it all worth it.

I've tried quite a few of the dishes here, and they've all been excellent.  In no particular order are my favorites:
cheddar enchilada's with hatch chiles and rice...spicy!
santa fe macaroni and cheese...again- spicy!
cod and shrimp tostada's- delicious!
shrimp fajitas
shrimp tacos

And for dessert:
fried banana wraps or the mango margarita sundae!"""
5,great food... love the pad thai....awesome atmosphere...
5,"These are simply the BEST sandwiches and salads. If you like your food (a) locally grown; (b) freshly made; (c) organic/all natural; and (d) yummy - and who doesn't? - this is the place for you.

Now, admittedly they have something of a soup-nazi routine set up and if you walk in and don't know the drill, it can be confusing.  So pay attention:   
1.  Look at menu.
2.  Decide what you want.
3.  Wait your turn to order.
4.  Order (give your name).
5.  Wait your turn to be called to pay the other girl for the order you placed.
6.  Pay her.
7.  Wait until your food is ready.
8.  Leave with your food.

Note that there is no place to sit inside - so you can either sit outside, or, (if it is 157 degrees out that day), see if you can find a place to sit over at LUX, they are very welcoming of Pane Bianco diners. 

It's all good."
5,"Oregano's is my FAVORITE restaurant in all of Tempe! The food is delicious - I've never been disappointed by a single appetizer, entrée or desert! And since they've recently add Blue Moon beer on draft I could stay here on the patio all day. Bonus: The wait staff is incredibly fun and friendly. Just a really great place to dine!"
5,"They had Kool Aid! i was so happy to see it :)

The chicken and waffles were really good... my girlfriend and I went straight there from the airport, before going to our hotel, and it was completely worth it... 

yeah, waiting outside in 100 degree heat isn't ideal, but for 10 minutes you can deal with it... especially when they had someone outside giving out water

If you're ever in Phoenix like us, or live out there, definitely stop in!!!"
5,"I have been here 3 times, and find it unique to Phoenix with a country French ambience without being ""cute-sy."" The patio is one of the loveliest we have here in Scottsdale. My daughter and I celebrated an early Mother's Day here recently. We were seated in just the right spot on the patio to tuck my grandson and his stroller in a corner next to the table. We splurged on some white sangria for lunch.....so pretty it had it's photo posted on Facebook. The Brie and Carmelized apples also came with grapes and strawberries and it was a very large serving of cheese. It could easily be a meal or feed 4 as an appetizer. We actually ran out of bread, because the Brie wheel was a nice large serving. The smoked ham sandwiches on crusty baguette are so good that I am craving them a few days later ....we used the still-warm gooey Brie on them, too. This place is just special! Plan an event, take a guest. It is a spot that will make it memorable. This was my first lunch as a new Grandmother with my daughter. My daughter is from the beach area in SCal, and she was wow'd. Thanks for the memories.......beautiful day."
5,Good food at a good price.
5,I'm sorry to say that they closed their doors for good just a few weeks ago!
5,This is an awesome family owned business. We've had consistently fresh and delicious food each time we've been here. They homemake things like their ranch dressing to take them to a different level than other places. Highly recommend this place. Prices are not bad either.
5,"Have you ever eaten somewhere and just can't get the craving out of your head and you have to go back!  This is the place that does it to me.  I've decided I need to try everything on their menu!

You have to try the Roasted Turkey and Stuffing it is to DIE for!  And the mac 'n cheese  so yummy.    I've also had the Prosciutto and Fig Jam sandwich and I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  I had that with fruit which was good.  

Guess where I'm going for lunch... yeah there because I need it after doing this review.  :-)  

Oh and before I forget... When the weather is nice sit out side!  You will love it."
5,"This is by far the best and most authentic Mexican food I've had in this area of town. I try and get different dishes each time I visit and have yet to be disappointed. 

If you're looking for an amazing location/view/atmosphere, this probably isn't the place for you. If you're looking for amazing food, then you've come to the right place. 

The prices are great for what you get. The quesadillas are served on a pizza tray so bring your appetite!"
5,"I love Honey Bear's!  I've been visiting their restaurants for years.  I've been to the one on Van Buran, the one on Central and this one in Tempe.  They have the runniest sauce on earth but dang it tastes great!  I love the pulled pork sandwiches but not the long lines at lunch.  When I went after 1pm in the afternoon I stood in a line of one - me."
5,"This my favorite Chipotle ever!!! It's so consistent and good! No hormones in the meat makes this ""fast"" food an A+ for me!!! Yum!!!"
5,Our server Gary was awesome. Food was amazing...an experience.
5,"If you don't love Guissepe's, you don't love Italian. Kindly find your way to a chain restaurant that serves bland, unseasoned, frozen-then/microwaved meats, sauces that are fit for an old folks home and an ""endless"" pasta and salad bar. Go to these places, because Guissepe's is not for you.  It's for lovers of true Northern/Northeast American Italian cuisine. Chicken Parm that is fried, NOT baked, thank you very much. Meatballs that use beef, veal and pork. Sauce that use LOTS of salt, as it should be. Leave your dietary worries at home.

 In a word: perfecto.

Robert's passion for music (he's a well known accomplished cellist in NY circles) and food is unparalleled. He is without peer in the state of Arizona. 

But be warned... there ain't no endless pasta bowl here.
 
Their weekday lunches are equally superior. This is Italian the way we had it growing up in North Jersey."
5,"I do a lot of traveling and during a quick trip to Phoenix, I was able to get two classes in at their studio. It was very clean and the people were friendly. I did think the studio was excessively hot my second class but everyone else seemed to be ok with it so perhaps it was just me. 

I would defiantly return if I were in the area again."
5,"The BEST of the BEST!

I agree with Daren C.  Killer Burgers, Steaks, Prime Rib and of course ribs.

Food melts in your mouth.  Make this your next restaurant stop.  You will not be disappointed."
5,"Delicious yet again! Pho, garlic green beans, papaya salad...they can do no dish wrong. The owner, Justina, is hip, cool, gorgeous and awesome! It's BYOB so bring a nice wine or beer...no corking fee so don't forget to tip well!

If you're eating and there's a big line of others waiting, please do what we do and go across the street to gelato so that other people don't have to wait an hour."
5,"My gf and I just tried the Oggie bc we werent super hungry.  Even with that, the food was super yummy.  I wonder what would happen to us if we are actually starving.  the sauce that came with the Oggie was excellent too, so I suggested that you shouldnt eat the pasty without the sauce.  The decoration in the store is quite unique: church pews and wall and table deocrations.  It's a must go if you are around the area."
1,"I don't like the pizza hear and if you go for lunch there are no specials by the slice.  The ranch tastes bottled and tastes gross.  The ingredients are not fresh but rather canned (also gross).  The chicken wings were not that great either.  The atmosphere was nice for a casual place with a couple of flat screen TV's on the wall.  I will not be going back to this place, so hopefully they get better soon since Barro's pizza is going in the area soon."
1,veerrrrrryyyyyyyyy dirty. I think I will buy them some clorox wipes and light bulbs for their sign out front. I made 12 u-turns trying to find this place.
1,"This was by far the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.  I paid $20.00 for a show and dinner. I received the show only because it was from an outside source. The show was 2 hours long and by the time it was over half the restaurant I'd say 50 to 80 people still had not been served. They didn't have enough menu's for people to even order off of. Some guy in shorts walked around with buckets of silverware wiping them on his shorts then placing them on the table. The show started at 7:00, at 9:30 I still had no food. The people who did get food complained that it was terrible. Maybe I should be happy I didn't get any food. When I asked again about our order the waitress said she would take care of it. The guys in the kitchen were overheard saying ""f---k those people no more orders! not only did we not get the dinner we already paid for they flat out refused to give us dinner or our money back. We ended up at Dennys eating eggs at 11:00 . Seriously I've never had such a bad experience in my life. Can you imagine paying for a dinner then being refused the dinner or a refund? unbelievable"
1,"I went here because all my friends were peeing their pants about how good it is. Wrong.  The slow (perhaps retarted) staff with no customer service, alongside the barely mediocre tasting pizza both contributed to my disdain for this awful eatery. Fuck it...stick to Slices."
1,"I'm very displeased with the service I receive from the Republican party in Arizona.  First, they provide us with John McCain.  Then, Jan Brewer.  Then they crap SB 1070 all over us, which we didn't even vote on.  I've never received anything but lousy politics from these people."
1,"Let me first say that we are fans of the W Hotel and have stayed in many of their hotels around the nation and are overall happy with the accommodations and customer service.  

I'm a local Phoenician who resides in the Arcadia neighborhood and frequents many of the wonderful restaurants and hotels this City has to offer.  After hearing MANY negative reviews from co-workers, family, and friends, my fiancé and I decided to give the W Hotel Scottsdale a shot prior to forming an opinion of our own for this hotel/restaurant/bar.

During a night out on the town with visiting and local friends, we opted to give this place a try.  Upon approaching the entrance of the bar, security tells us that we're not welcome here due to one of the members of our party not having closed toe shoes and another not having a collared shirt.  The attire our group was wearing was more than appropriate for any Phoenix/Scottsdale restaurant/bar.  Let me remind you that's is July in Phoenix, and over one-hundred degrees at the time of night we went to the W and the six of us just finished a dinner at an adjacent, popular restaurant.  The staff was flat out rude to not only us, but others in line wanting and willing to spend money and support the local hotel.

I will strongly suggest not staying here or supporting the quality of business they are running here.  During a time of a slowing economy and tourism, many businesses are forced to rely solely on the best possible customer service to attract and retain business--the W Hotel fell way short of this.

I was very discouraged after our experience here and will agree with the many other reviewers that this place in not worth supporting.  

Phoenix/Scottsdale has many great places to experience, so don't settle for this place."
1,Angry Bro Bar !  Please go here if you wear size smedium affliction shirts you will love it. The bar is lame. Kid you not there was not five minutes that went by where two people didn't try and fight each other.
1,"After stepping off the plane hungry, I looked around the terminal for food as I walked to the next gate. ""Wait a minute, I'm in Arizona. I should get some southwestern style food or mexican food. Is that a burrito place? Surely it can't be bad."" I ordered a #1, standard burrito. I take a bite. And another. ""Not bad I thought."" Then I took another bite. And promptly spit it out.

The cheddar cheese in my burrito was moldy. And no, I'm sure it wasn't blue cheese. It was even obvious visually. After pointing the cheese out to the manager, she brushed it off as ""the bag was just opened, it's not possible"" even after showing the obvious mold. People around me started looking uncomfortable. Someone muttered ""wow"" and stepped out of the line.

The best part? I wasn't even offered a refund or a new burrito, or an apology for the moldy burrito. Are you kidding me?"
1,"Horrible experience. We had a home emergency which forced us to move out for 15 days. We referred to them by a friend. We explained to them we're Seniors on limited income but assured them they'd be paid in full. We paid the medical and our insurance co verbally told them that once the bill was submitted they would be paid.  But, No, No, NO!!!!  ""Not our policy""  They were holding our two kids for ransom!!!

Horrible, uncaring staff to deal with."
1,"After landing in PHX but before embarking on a 2.5 hour drive to Flagstaff, i thought Wendy's would be a safe and easy place to grab some food on the go...well, I was wrong.

* Chicken Nuggets: dry, freezer-burned meat with extra hard double-fried shell.

* French Fries: super hot, crunchy, over-fried french-fry-shaped fry-shells. so hard and crunchy that i thought i was eating french-fry chips.

* Junior Bacon Cheese Burger: bacon and burger meat both tasted dehydrated.

Guess what, last thing I want after a 4hr flight and landing in 100+ weather is hot, dry, crunchy, tasteless food!"
1,"3 months, 22 emails, 10 plus calls and (I think) we have the final refund from Budget! 
Stay clear of Budget Rental they DO NOT care about customers or resolving their monumental mistakes!"
1,The salad plates were not chilled... As they usually are it however is a busy night but something's are expected at the olive garden... The food tasted like it was under a hot lamp for so long it tasted almost hard and also under cooked for the seafood... Not a great experience at the olive garden there are certain things expected... The expectations are not that high shouldnt be that hard to do....
1,"The Vine Tavern (i'll omit the word Eatery as i'm fairly certain this term can't be applied to the food they serve at this establishment) is a vortex sort of culmination hang-out for low-brow Fred Durst clones and future (day-shift) strippers. With that being said, this cesspool of a building hasn't burned to the ground yet so I feel compelled to warn others before they consider spending an evening there.

Being new to the Tempe area, myself and a small group of friends decided to drop in to check it out.  As we approached the-dimly lit building I began to have second thoughts: my bloomy sense was tingling (more on this later). As we entered we were greeted by a lovely bouncer type gentlemen who begged us to pay the 5$ cover.... seriously. We were seated towards the back near a group of teenage mothers and their burly counterparts. We ordered food...

The food arrived in a timely manner, it may have been poisoned but i was too hungry to care. I ordered the mushroom/swiss burger.... 9 dollars-ish. If Mcdonalds ever begins selling their products in the frozen food aisle of grocery stores it might taste something like what they serve at The Vine. I had immediate food regret, my only consolation was the 1$ you call its and the poor old man behind the mic with his acoustic guitar wrapping up his set. Surreal. .. . .We regrettably paid and escaped out the back. 

Good: Cheap Drinks !!!!  
Bad: You may be stabbed!!!"
1,"I used to love Banana Republic.  I stopped by at lunch to buy a few outfits, I wasted quite a bit of time in this store...to an frazzeling degree.  The choppy layout of the new store is annoying.  The clothing line changed drastically so you look like you just came from an overpriced (and cold) beach.  I was looking to dress sharp and professional, not wrinkled and hap-hazzard.  I wanted short sleeves, not flimsy spagetti straps, long sleeved blouses and SWEATERS (hello..its JUNE...and ARIZONA.)  Banana Republic's new format and collection is a huge FAIL."
1,"Ok, so I have to share my morning experience. But first I must start off by saying this: I'm no moron. Honest. 

So, this morning I stopped for gas. My tank was getting dangerously low and there was no way I'd make it to work. That's okay, for I allotted time this morning for re-filling my tank. From my casa, I turned East on Indian School, vaguely remembering there's a Quick Trip nearby. Perfect. I had stopped there before. 

But it wasn't a Quick Trip I saw at the corner of Central and Indian School. Not wanting to risk running out of gas, I opted to stop here, at this ampm station. 

I pulled up to the closest gas tank, got out of my car, took off my gas cap and reached for the gas nozzle. Only then I discovered there was no pay-at-the-pump option. The short notice on the pump said to select my grade and start filling. ""Wow,"" I thought, ""It's so odd for a station to trust people - especially in this area - to not drive off without paying."" 

So, I followed the instructions, but nothing happened. I kept hitting the grade button. It kept beeping back at me. Still nothing. To top it off (no pun intended), the nozzle was wrapped in this huge rubber tube thing that compressed when I applied pressure to the handle. I had never seen anything like it. 

Thinking my particular pump was fuct up, I pulled my car up to the next one. That's when I saw it - this strange machine, like an Amtrack ticket dispenser. I approached with curiously. That's when I realized. You swipe your card at this central machine (or deposit cash, if that's your preference) and then go back to your pump. Ah-ha. This is how this station works. So, I did just that. I punched in my gas pump number (4) and went back to my car to re-fill the tank. Already annoyed at this point, I figured I'd pump enough gas to get me through the next couple of days. 

Only, it wasn't pumping. The long rubber thingy was hindering my ability to hook the nozzle up to my gas tank. UGH. So, that's when I flexed my muscles and applied enough pressure to squeeze out $12 worth of gas. Then I re-hooked the nozzle on its perch and walked back to the strange machine for my receipt - it told me to do so when I swiped my card. Only, no receipt came out. I punched the keypad with defiance and walked off. 

Stupid ampm station. Since when does any gas station benefit from being different? I'm so used to pay-at-the-pump; you just swipe your card, select your grade, pump your gas, grab your receipt and go. Quick Trip doesn't torment me like this. There is no rubber nozzle thingy in my way. Grr. Screw this. I'm never going back there again.

1,"I would've gone 2 stars if I were more forgiving. I could reason that it was the end of the day, that a big crowd of wayward children had just come through, or that a hurricane had blown out the back of the restaurant. But then, I tasted it.

It looks as if Yogurtini is pretty well-loved around these parts, and I'm sorry to report otherwise. It's was like a bomb had gone off. The tables were filthy, the machine handles were all gunked up, there was assorted debris on the floor. The two teenagers working were too busy gossiping about who knows what to do their jobs. When we walked in there were a few customers sampling flavors among the ruins, with no employees in sight. We grabbed some sample cups from the register and dodged napkins and froyo puddles (and other customers) to try some different flavors. The levers are the type that if you pull just a bit too far you make a mess all over your hand, especially when trying to squirt a tiny bit in a sample cup. This mess is then added to the greater mess of everyone else attempting this same operation, and no-one attempting to clean it up.

The stuff was real overpowering, to where instead of tasting like what it was supposed to taste like, it was bordering on medicine or like a bad imitation of what it was supposed to be. Like, cheesecake doesn't taste like that, good cheesecake anyway... And neither does cake batter, or banana. Where did the yogurt part go? And how do you screw up cookies and cream, exactly? The two that were the best (and most edible) were the Irish mint and the red velvet, and that's what we mostly ended up with.

The decor didn't add to our experience. Everything is a mint green, but it doesn't come off as retro or even minty, but more like dated and hospital-like. Some people really like it but I found it unappetizing.

A surly teenager magically appeared as we approached the register, only to disappear again soon after we paid. We sat down at a dirty table and dealt with our choices while the two teens again made an appearance, half-mopping-half-attempting-to-clean while chattering back and forth about their dating woes. We finished our yogurt but both strongly considered abandoning the whole affair.

I very well could have walked into Yogurtini at the worst possible time on the worst possible day, with all the factors stacked against them, but I won't be returning to find out if this was the case."
1,"Wow this place was steps below horrible. I should have known better considering the place was empty on ASU game night. The food was greasy, and flavorless. Everything on the plate was flat... Ya I said it.... Flat. Bland, disappointing food. Save your money and eat at taco bell. You will thank me later."
1,"Groupon rip-off. Small salad, three extremely small plates of mediocre pasta desserts that cloyed the palate. All for an advertised value of $90. Will NEVER return."
1,"Tried to eat here Friday night for the seafood buffet. We waited in line for 90 minutes before finally giving up. Would have been much sooner but the drive down there from my house is almost an hour. 

They have three lines, tiered based on the level of player's club card. The diamond card holders waltzed right in and the hostesses would seat from that line until it was empty before anyone from the 'lesser' lines would be seated. At the end, we stood still... didn't move an inch... for 20 minutes. So no-one from our line was seated for 20 minutes while dozens of people waltzed right through in the diamond and platinum lines. 

What a fucking joke. Waster my whole evening trekking down there dreaming of crab legs just to be snubbed by them.

Never, EVER again."
1,"I want to like this place as it is in the neighborhood and there aren't many other options around here, but this is probably the worst restaurant/bar I've ever had the misfortune of going to. 

My last trip I sat down to order a beer at the bar.  The bartender takes about five minutes to get me a beer, despite the bar being nearly empty, as he was too busy for me with his time and focus instead spent flirting with one of the servers.  

I drink my beer and want another.  The glass sits empty for about five minutes while he paces around the bar.  I try on three occasions to get his attention and ask for another.  The dude is just ignoring me at this point.  I guess they don't want my business and I just leave.  He can have the 8 cents he owes me in change for a tip... I just want out of here.  I feel bad when I leave that he even got the 8 cents from me.  I hope he spends it well.

On other trips here my wife and I have had the food.  It's not any better than the service sadly.  I have an English Bulldog at home with a poop eating problem and I'm not sure he would even find this food acceptable.  Overall just the worst restaurant around and it's no surprise why the place always looks so dead out front.  Nobody's there because it's simply horrible.  Avoid at all cost.  I wouldn't eat here again, but would give the bar another shot if I heard the replaced all the help.  Whoever owns this place needs to clean house.  Looking at other reviews on here, I see I'm not alone in my feelings about the service.  Get rid of these people already... just sad!!"
1,"Absolutely disgusting.  I had enchiladas and a taco, just to give them a chance.  This was the worst mexican food I've ever had.  Waaaaaay too much government tasting cheese on the food, and hardly any meat.  I do have really high standards because I grew up on Tex-Mex but this was just pathetic......"
1,"While the menu looked promising, have no idea if the food is any good since the hostess failed to even acknowledge our presence when we walked in the door.   We patiently stood there for several minutes while she walked around us to greet and seat two other parties.   Since we were still unable to get her attention,  we left and went to Tommy Bahama across the street."
1,"Buca Di Beppo is literally, italian restaurant hell. You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else 'italian' they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. It's a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta.


It's embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table, bland food.

When they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure it's nice, but I'd rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good. Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. It's just dead. Dead food. No life, no flavor, not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelina's frozen lunch package.

Far from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, it's all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldn't have to the mandatory gratuity. Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something."
1,"I ate here for the first time a few weeks ago on a Friday night/Saturday morning after seeing a show at the Tempe Improv.

I came in around midnight and the place was not that busy. The waitress was pretty nice (did everything expected for a waitress) and the guy who I thought was the manager was easy to talk to. However, those are the only two good things I can say about the restaurant.

I ordered the BBQ wings and they were TERRIBLE. The flavor was very bland and half cold. The blue cheese I ordered was quite watery as well.

I also sat by the kitchen and noticed that a guy in the back was washing a stool in a sink near where the food was made. Needless to say, I won't be eating at Hooters anytime soon."
1,"How does this restaurant generate so many 4 and 5 star ratings? 

I know it was on the food channel, but honestly the food was sub-par. Maybe it was just an off day, but I have a feeling it wasn't. The prices were not outrageous, but it wasn't cheap either. The atmosphere was nice, if very cafeteria like.

But the food was way way too ""greasy."" And bland. And my stomach now aches after eating there...."
1,"Wednesday 7pm.  This place is your average over priced, lack of taste chain food restaurant and this place was no different. 

I have to say, I was super disappointed as I have always heard rave reviews, now I'm starting to question who I associate with and their taste in food.

Service=slow.
Food=just tastes like salt
Noise=loud and they do a dance...like a lot.

Go somewhere else and skip Joe's Crabs."
1,"We were driving around Chandler area to find a decent place to eat and Mido Sushi caught our attention. ""Oh, Okay!"" - I thought and walked right in. We were greeted right away with a good waitress, but somehow I found her voice was really annoying!
The food came out after 10minutes and I was disappointed with the sashimi! It wasn't as fresh as I expected. The soy sauce tasted very weird and too salty. By far this is not the most decent sushi restaurant I've experienced. 
Kabuki and Masa sushi are still my best choice so far."
1,"For the past three months I've been receiving unsolicited spam text messages from these clowns, so regardless of how nice a place this might be, I'll never stay with them or any other affiliated property for that reason alone. I've complained to the hotel (I was blown off), blocked them from my cell phone account, and filed a complaint with the feds. So...since the hotel continues to find it appropriate to light up my cell phone at 3 am with spam texts, I hereby award them a generous one-star rating."
1,"How very disappointing!  Nello's had a delightful menu with an array of salads, pizzas and sandwiches. Not Jac's. If the new restaurant wants to be a ""pub"", it should have a wider variety of selections. The menu was sad.

Due to dietary restrictions, I asked for a plain garden salad. Lettuce, tomatoes and onions. And it wasn't very fresh either. Sad.

Guess we'll be driving up north to Pima Crossing to visit Nello's."
1,"I have been to a buffet like this before, but I will never go to this particular one again. 

The food all looked fresh as we went through the food line selecting our favorites and stacking our bowl to the sky. We selected our sauces and turned it over to the grill. 

The cook doused our dishes with water, quickly cooked the ingredients, and returned them in a new bowl. 

There is a selection of crispy wonton bits, rice and soups for you to add to your tray at no cost. I selected no rice as they were all old and burnt to the pan. I chose the hot and sour soup because it is ma favorite. 

Free-range and refills on beverages. 

Sat down to eat, was not impressed. I could not muster to try a second spoon of the soup as it was absolutely disgusting. The bowl of ingredients were all bland, perhaps from the overuse of water at grilling, and I am almost certain the tofu had gone bad, The slivers of meat that my husband had selected tasted fowl as well. We obviously did not get to far into our meal before leaving. Had we not already paid there would have been several complaints from me, and changes in selections. 

We could have taken the left overs home, but opted to leave them instead. 

Suffice to say, I do NOT recommend."
1,"Rarely do I give a 1 star rating but after four attempts in four months to get my fax line and internet rolling I can honestly say they have earned this.  After finally showing up for a scheduled appointment the tech told us our internet was fine but we disagree because we are getting the same speed we had with Qwest in Cave Creek (SLOW)  and they are charging us $64 a month for what they call the upgraded 20mbs.  Furthermore, I tried to send out a couple faxes after he left and the line is not responding.  Im going to drive down to the store tomorrow and demand that they remove the fees for service I have not received and just get efax.  As I noted in the first review we were excited to upgrade to faster internet so that makes this experience even worse."
1,"So the food at this place is good. Well the sliced turkey sud. But when it came to delivery and internet ordering. Oh my god the incompetence of these people. After and hour, 15 mins after the food was suppose to be delivered (the order was 2 turkey subs and garlic cheese bread.) I called and was told that there was no delivery guy and if i can come pick it up that they would knock off 25%. But the foods not ready yet, how long does it take to make 2 subs. So i pick up the goods and damned if i didn't check the bag they didn't give me the 2nd sub. Ugh they never checked the order. If you have online ordering  you need to follow though. So with a second phone call and a second trip to the place and 2 hrs after the original order i FINALLY get home and eat. The only good thing i got was a free lunch.  For that I give them a 1"
1,"Still quite poor both in service and food. maybe I made a mistake and ordered Sichuan Gong Bao ji ding for what seemed like people from canton district. Unfortunately to get the good service U have to speak Mandarin/Cantonese. I do speak a smattering but try not to use it as I never feel confident about the intonation. 

The dish came out with zichini and bell peppers (what!??)  Where is the peanuts the dried fried red peppers and the large pieces of scallion. On pointing this out all I got was "" Oh you like peanuts.. ok I will put some on"" and she then proceeded to get some peanuts and sprinkle it on the chicken.

Well at that point I was happy that atleast the chicken pieces were present else she would probably end up sprinkling raw chicken pieces on it like the raw peanuts she dumped on top of the food. 

Well then  I spoke a few chinese words and the scowl turned into a smile and she then became a bit more friendlier. 

Unfortunately I do not condone this type of behavior. It is all in poor taste..."
1,Poor service-small portions-pricey
1,"Sadly with new owners comes changes on menu.  My fav Barbecue chicken salad
no longer has a hint of the same taste. It should now be called flavor of tomato. 
 Also sad to find out that the most outstanding veggie sandwich now tastes like it comes from another country. Again not a single hint of similarity of same flavor. Im sure many people will love these new changes.  Yet, Im sad it's not the same. I woke up today dreaming about the old veggie sandwich! No joking!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Mediocre, bland, low quality food topped off with painfully slow service.  I worked in the neighborhood and continued to return occasionally ""just in case it's gotten better"", for reasons I could never fathom once the plate of abysmal food was placed on the table.  The salsa and rice are usually good, but that's the most I have to offer."
1,Our family made the mistake of dining here on Thanksgiving. Everything from the table to the food to the clueless and absent waiter was outright below average and certainly no where near the kind of restaurant described in the other reviews (which I wonder now if were written by the owner or manager). What a disappointing holiday.
1,"Everytime I have gone in this store I have left feeling like a big pile of poop. The staff is sooo horrible. I read the other reviews and it seems to be a common thing which really sucks because I would probably shop here a lot more if the staff wasn't a bunch of pricks. P.S. I found a skirt at Target for $10 that is EXACTLY like one they carry, except they want $40 dollars and your soul."
1,"Once again, THE TROUGH SLURPERS offer far too many stars to this mundane eatery, proving again that they are truly CANAILLE of the first order.:
Slow indifferent service
Mediocre food
The kind of wine that patrons of kokopelli swill with delight, calling it ambrosia when it's actually dishwater.
But..as with Kokopelli, it keeps the shit eaters out of the better restaurants! So, I say to you canaille..flock, flock there with your disruptive screaming children and your leathery palates."
1,"OVERPRICED & DECEITFUL & RUDE!

I should have read the reviews before I came here! I took a bridesmaid dress in to have the top taken in like 1/4 inch, not much. I asked her, how much will this cost? She assured me it would not be ""much"". It was $60 and she hardly did a thing, can't even steam it there. I was irate but calmly asked her if she could charge less and she screamed NO! She said it's because the dress cost more. Yeah...like that matters A guy was there dropping off pants that needed taken OUT which is a lot more work, she charge him $18.50 for each pair. I don't know if that is good for pants a lot but her pricing scale seems way off!

Previously I've been to 5th Avenue Alterations and they charge me $50 for a floor length brdiesmaid dress that they took in the whole thing AND steamed it. They're also polite and will work with you on pricing and communicate with you beforehand. Definitely worth the few extra minutes of a drive!!"
1,"Let's talk about failure, baby.

Hey, if your idea of salad is punishment via tasteless lettuce and mealy tomatoes splashed with the most generic, industrial vinaigrette, you've found just the right place to BDSM your tongue. Go for it!

I ordered Capellini Checca, and I had it substituted with Spaghetti (I like more girth re: pasta).  What I got was the limpest pile of spaghetti that couldn't be revived with a lifetime supply of Viagra.  The DOA pasta was topped with a pathetic sprinkling of more mealy tomatoes (the menu says Fresh Roma Tomatoes- these had the texture and taste of a dying horse's ass moreso than fresh produce).  The faint, acrid garlic tasted like it came out of a shaker bottle and not a bulb- and motherf*&k, respectable Checca should have more than 1/16 teaspoon of microscopically chopped basil.  

This place makes Old Spaghetti Factory look like fine dining, and I would rather starve than be even close to that chain restaurant of culinary doom.  Hell, this place is the  disowned, cracked-out junkie brother of OSF. It's really *that* terrible.

I gave them the single star only because the management was incredibly lovely, and did not charge for the unforgivable disaster masquerading as edible food worth paying for."
1,"Horrible! I had a gel manicure. The tech didn't let my old gel soak off long enough so she scraped, clipped and filed so hard to get it off that it left my natural nail extremely thin and flimsy. The new polish that was put on was thick in some areas and thinner in others. I didn't realize it until I got home. I grabbed my purse and almost broke my naturally long nails because they were so frail. I get the gel manicure because it has a thicker finish and makes my nails firmer. I called and told them about what happened. The gentleman who answered the phone told me that I was wrong and that they would not refund my money. I will never go back and I am sure sorry I ever did in the first place."
1,"I am writing this review only for the optical department. I accidentally poked my eye with a branch yesterday and knew I had damaged it so I went to the Gilbert Costco optician and asked if I could be seeing on an emergency basis. The receptionist asked me if I could come back in 5 hours to which I stated it was an emergency and could asked the Dr if she could see me. She asked her and she said no she did not have time.
I find it very unbelievable that on an emergency basis they can turn someone away who has a Costco optics patient for years. I recognize that she had a patient at the time but I said I could wait until after so she could at least take 5 minutes to tell me if I should go to a hospital or not. Dont ever waste your time going here if you need immediate attention for an emergency because they will not make room for you."
1,"I would give this place NO STARS but Yelp! wants me to give at least one. 

I went here with my boyfriend last night for dinner and next to our awful Bucca di Beppo (Scottsdale) experience, I have to say, this one is on my list of MOST TERRIBLE restaurant experiences. The service was so bad, we didn't even get to try the food! 

True Yelper that I am, I did my homework before suggesting that we come here for dinner. I saw all the reviews about the ""bad service"" , but I paid more attention to the ""Cheap"" and  ""Delicious Pho"" reviews because after all, you can't knock it til you've tried it. Yes, the place looks as divey as any food dive gets, yes the place isn't as clean as it probably can be, but hey, all the best pho I've  had (Da Vang, Khai Hoan, Pho Thanh) has been from some of the diviest pho spots in town.  I was excited. 

It was around 6pm and the place wasn't busy (there were 5 other customers besides us, and 3 of them were on their way out), so we went ahead and sat ourselves down. The server gave us menus, and made her way back behind the cash register. 

After looking over the menu for less than 2 minutes (I usually go for the spring rolls + everything pho whenever I visit a new spot), we were ready to order. I tried to make eye contact with our server but she seemed to be preoccupied with laughing and talking with the pre-teen sitting behind the counter with her. I finally made eye contact with her, she looked at me and I looked at her, and she turned back to her conversation. For the next 15 minutes I tried to get her attention to alert her that we were ready to order - no luck. But then I noticed that both her and the girl she was talking to were looking over at us and laughing, occasionally pointing in our direction and laughing some more. I wasn't about to give up because I was determined to try some of their well-reviewed food, but after a quarter of an hour spent trying to get their attention with them just laughing and pointing at us, my boyfriend and I had enough. The way they treated us was disrespectful and humiliating, so we walked out and drove across town to another Vietnamese restaurant. 

We are never going back to this restaurant, and I suggest you don't either. Just as it isn't acceptable for customers to be rude to restaurant staff, it also isn't okay for restaurant staff to be blatantly rude to customers who have not done anything to deserve bad treatment. We did not deserve the type of treatment we got at this restaurant and I am seriously fuming with anger as I write this review. I don't care how delicious and cheap your food is, you cannot use that as an excuse to make customers who come in feel like somehow they are undeserving individuals. 

Thanks, but no thanks, Pho House. I don't need to feel disrespected and belittled just so I can try your cheap Vietnamese food. I have plenty of Vietnamese friends who have moms who can probably cook better than you can and will treat us a million times better than your staff did last night."
1,"I went today to meet my daughter for lunch.  We are both big sushi enthusiasts.  The interior and atmosphere was beautiful.  Well appointed.
The service was excellent.  We ordered edamame, was good...nothing to rave about.  Not much you can do to mess that up.  Drinks were well poured but exspensive for what you got.  Ordered five different sushi rolls.
All five were bland, not much flavor and stale.  The fish was not fresh.
Paid $12 for a soft shell crap roll and it tasted days old.  Will not go back.
Did here they have good pizza and a happy hour at three.  My daughter says to give it another try.  We'll see... I'll let you know if I do."
1,"HA HAHAHAHAHA! 
""Pit"" is right.... man, this place would have been a terrible idea if i wasn't already expecting lameness.
now occupying the space that has seen the death of not one, but two dance club (411 and Level), Peach Pit Afterdark.... I mean Cherry Lounge and Pit is beyond ghetto.
opened by the same people who do sugar daddy's and dos gringos, this place has all the sexiness and allure of a Trails commercial. You know? I was half expecting to turn a corner to see a neon colored bikini-clad bleached blonde on top of a motor boat. well, they've updated the look of the cage-trapped go-go dancers to mini panties with knee-high dragon rider boots with fuzzy muppet skins adorning them.

the vids of drunken lounge-goers (a la daddy's and now dos) playing in tiny screens on the walls in hallways and behind bars in tact, interspersed with footage of seriously hagard looking chics doing ""sexy"" things like sucking on lollipops, cherries, winking (yes, she was winking right at you, wasn't she? inviting you in to her red-drenched lair to bask in the glow of a alcohol doused club circa 1992).

i'm not sure what the DRESS CODE we were so violently and largely reminded of in line, but the girl in front of me had on an oversized T-shirt, baggy jeans and flip flops (?) and they took her $5 and let her in no problem. i also saw a girl dressed exactly like peggy bundy...no joke, spandex black calf leggings, long spandwex shirt in orange, heels and a giant boob belt. it was so incredible i took a picture. she was not impressed with my observation, so i had to sneak the photo.

anyway.... take it for what it is, a club owned by dos gringos guys on mill ave."
1,"Service was slow and horrible. Got the steak and eggs.  Steak was half fat. Waiters response was ""Oh!  We have a new supplier"". He didnt take it back and charged us any way. Eggs were cold. Stay away from this place for eating. Bar looked happening."
1,I went there with a friend last year after reading so many good reviews. The service is good. We didn't have to wait but I didn't like the food I ordered. I had a salmon with caper butter sauce. The fish is not fresh at all and the food is too geasy for me.
1,"After bad experience, I will never return.  It is terrible since they didn't meet my expectation and the price is outrageous.  The most difficult part of the Pho is the broth (req 16 hours of preparation) and it tasted like water.  I had to add all kind of condiments to rescue it but can't even eat it.  The restaurant is very slow now and it confirmed what I meant with Asian restaurant.  If your fellow Asians don't patronize the place, it is  because your food did not meet our expectation.  Try across the street to the Rice plate Kim Thanh for their rice dish.  It is night and day."
1,"From my door, it's a five minute stroll through the greenbelt to Dukes. They have a nice patio. They have enough TVs to show all MLB/NFL/NBA games. They have plenty of shuffleboard and pool tables. Yet, I've only been to Duke's a few times and I am not going back. This place is just bad.

Mixed drinks are poured short and use cheap mixers (such as bottled sour mix for margaritas). They offer a pretty basic beer selection. I think PBR pitchers might be more modestly priced, but that might be only when they're on ""special.""

The food is pretty bad, even for bar food. And pricey. Sure, the menu is gigantic and I've tried many different items, but I didn't find anything good. Everything seems to be made from ""freezer to fryer"" or packaged products. I'm not exaggerating: the burger and fries for about $8 is a thin, previously frozen patty with a handful or supermarket fries. I could go on about salads, sandwiches, and ribs. In the same price range, you can get a much better version of anything on the menu at Four Peaks or Zipps or even Devil's Advocate.

One of the owners was there on a few occasions. I guess being the boss of (and drinking in) his own bar is some sort of dream of his. He treats the place like his kingdom. He'll ask patrons ""how is everything?"" and get mad at them if they have anything negative to say. I feel bad for the rest of the service staff; they seem to be above average, but when the overall situation is this bad it just doesn't matter.

In this city, sports bars are a dime a dozen. I'd rather go elsewhere."
1,"First, I hope La Fonda management reads these reviews and takes steps to improve their restaurant.  Second, we miss the bloody mary bar too.  Hubby & I visited LF a few weeks ago on a Saturday night for dinner. We asked the waitress a general question about a beer and she made something up that was ridiculously wrong.  Okay, she doesn't know beer.  We liked the chips & salsa, it was a good start, then I took a sip of my water.  What the?  I know what Tempe tap water tastes like, but this was weird.  The aftertaste made me cringe, I couldn't drink it, even with a slice of lemon in it, maybe it was the ice.  Hubby ordered chicken enchiladas, which he orders practically everywhere, and it was so bad he didn't finish it.  My meal was not memorable either.  I wanted to love this place, or at least like it.  We walked out of there terribly disappointed, I doubt we'll go back."
1,"I have only been going to LA Fitness for about 6 months. I live in Scottsdale and work in Phoenix, so I go to the 20th St & Camelback, Scottsdale and Oak and McCormick Ranch locations.  The Scottsdale locations are GREAT! They are clean, the staff is really nice and I see people cleaning the equipment when they are done.  What is it with the Camelback crowd?  The place really smells bad! It really needs a good cleaning. There has been this big spot on the carpet in front of the womens locker room since I started.  I was on the treadmill the other day really noticing how stinky it was and then the guy next to me finished up and just walked off, I swear he was sweating like a pig, left the equipment drenched! UGH!!!  Good God! I couldn't believe it, Can't the employees make these people clean after themselves?? The reviews are right about the staff just hanging around at the front desk.....they should be cleaning something, anything.  It really is a shame that this centrally located facility is a real stinky mess!!  I can't wait for the new one to open on 7th Avenue! Maybe then they may clean up their act."
1,"Terrible food, terrible service.

I ordered chicken fried rice. The waiter brings me a bowl and says, ""chicken fried rice, right?"" I look into the bowl and it's a bowl of brown rice. This must be a joke. I tell him that's wrong, and next me brings me a bowl of rice, seemingly fried?, with vegetables and no chicken. I bring that back to the counter and say my order had chicken in it, bringing my receipt along. So finally, they bring me a bowl of chicken fried rice.

Or at least their version of it.

I didn't think it was possible to actually screw up something as simple as chicken fried rice. The rice itself was cheap long grain rice. It was inedible due to the how stale/hard it was. Like absolutely no water absorption. And the rice was all covered in something that made it very wet and practically slimy. Disgusting. I have no idea how people can eat this.

Oh, and that server who brought me the brown rice and claimed it was fried rice tried to bring lettuce wraps to the table next to me saying it was their salad. There's a nice picture on the wall which shows you what the salad is supposed to look like, and it's not lettuce wraps.

The best thing about my meal was the fountain drink, which cost $1.85. The Circle K in the same plaza has bigger cups for 99 cents."
1,Prices are often way too high!
1,OMG! what is the rave about? this place is disgusting! it's dirty and the food is not worth it! i came here with my family and we each order a little bit of everything that is suppose to be good and popular there. unfortunately everything is bad. i walked by the waiters and they were all cursing really loud in vietnamese to each other. the table is icky and it smell like my cooked up oil . ick! go to Pho ao sen instead at least it's clean.
1,"I understand I'm not dude and so I'm not there to state at your ""twin peaks"" however, that being said I am there to buy a beer and when it takes the bartender 20 minutes just to get a beer I'm over it. So I was never gonna come back but was forced with a group of friends who wanted to eat and was just as upset as the first time. Fries were soggy and our server disappeared. We all decided were not going back. Just because your a good looking server doesn't give you an excuse for sucking."
1,"DO NOT GO HERE.  One of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had.  The setup is a little like ""Pei Wei"" where they take your order, give you a number, and bring the food to your table.  Placed our order, and had to stalk other tables and hover over people eating trying to wait to get a table.  Waited a long time, all the while others who ordered after us found seats and got their food before us. Servers kept bringing my food to me since it was ready, but I still didn't have a table, so they kept saying they would ""put it under the heat lamp"" for me.  Finally eventually found a table, and then kept waiting and waiting for our food, which the manager claimed ""he had them remake"" since it was getting cold.  My food came, and it was cold and disgusting.  We had to get going since we were going to a show, and my mom's food still wasn't there.  The staff asked to see her receipt, since they couldn't find her order.  She went up to the manager and said she just wanted her money back since we had to go (it had been 45 minutes since we placed our order).  He said her food would not be ready for a while, and gave her some cash, and we left.  My mom never even ate, and my food was horrible.  I would NOT recommend this place, it's awful."
1,Donuts are worst I've ever had. I bought 2 dozen donuts using their 10.99 sale and it was the worst donuts I have ever had in my life. All the donuts were dry and stale. I should have gone a couple of miles over and bought Krispy Kreme. Krispy Kreme donuts are always fresh. These ones were worst that those that sat on the shelf for a week in a supermarket!
1,Completely shady.  Towed our U-haul as we were moving in to our new Apartment Complex.  Completely unethical and total crooks.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
1,"Look it upsets me that you have to give even one star. 

I can read the other reviews and I have been here more than a few times but tonight it was just beyond a bad dinner. 

Yes, we were the table of 7 people at about 8pm, yes we were group at the high top tables that were pushed together. You would have to remember us because we were the table that had 1/2 of a waiter. It was so nice of you to take the time to take our order and then let the waiter go home because he had been there since lunch. 

You know what sucks more than working 2 shifts? How about being the last table for the guy who worked 2 shifts, it was so nice of the manager to let him leave, but hey how about taking the time to have someone FINISH the open orders? 

Simply the food was not good and you are over priced.

But the worst part is that your staff is just not good at their job, THEY DONT CARE and that is a result of MANAGEMENT not caring."
1,"This Jack in the Box location has the worst service & food that I have found in the Phoenix metro area. Every time I have gone through the drive through there my order has either been wrong or inedible - how hard is it to make a taco without frying it into oblivion? The wait times are consistently more than 5 minutes...I think I will be spending that 5 minutes driving to another location, just to get the correct order & food that is properly prepared."
1,"I was looking into gyms around the area. Upon entering I was greeted by the front desk guy. I asked about memberships and then he said, ""Sorry we are sold out"". I stood there stunned. Then he snickered, ""Just kidding"". Trying to be a good sport I went with it. 

Next came the young sales guy. He was personable - at first anyways. Showed me around the gym and I was interested in joining. Next we went over to the childcare area since I have a little one. Children were in the room however the two girls monitoring the room were chatting it up with one another and ignoring the kids. Bad sign. I asked the girls if they were CPR certified and had fingerprinting and background checks. The world stopped for just a moment and they stared at me. I had interrupted their important conversation. Then they were both saying, ""Yeah, like, well, um, no, I mean yes,"". In other words, no straight answers. 

We sat at the sales guy's desk and the wheeling and dealing began. I felt like I was purchasing a new car. ""If you choose option A, you then can go to all the gyms."" ""If you choose option B, then only here"" . The whole time I could see the children's area and the kids were being completely ignored (and we are talking very little children). When I told the sales man I needed to think about it he switched into some type of Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde routine. ""Well you only have today to make a decision, after that no price guarantee!!!""   From there he was down right rude.

I walked out of there thinking what the heck just happened. Like Sarah G, I felt horrible when I left this gym.  It was an awful experience. Ended up getting a membership at Tangible Fitness on 7th Street. They don't have the same amenities however it is locally owned, and the people are very nice there."
1,"Have been an Ulta customer for a long time, but had never tried the salon until recently.  Was a HORRIBLE experience.  My stylist, Delia, ran 45 minutes late to start me, and on several occasions during the hair cut, stopped and kept looking around.  She made various odd faces as if to say my hair was a mess.  She not only didn't listen to what I wanted, but shot down the only thing I did ask for.  She said I wouldn't look good.  At the end of the painful ordeal, she then charged me for a conditioning service I didn't ask for.  At that point she directed me to the line at the front of the store, after which I waited in, they then sent me back to the salon to make the price correction.  (happened twice, then I asked for a manager)  Was very unprofessional all around and would NEVER go back!!!"
1,"I had not been to an Oregano's in like 10 years. They seems to be popping up all over here in AZ now so my buddy was in from out of town and he wanted to try, so why not.

I'll tell you ""Why NOT""... we has two thin crust pizzas... and I even hate to call them that. More like... crackers with melted cheese and some toppings.

That was some of the worst excuse for pizza I've ever had. Most of the fast-food delivery pizza I've had beats it -- and I do not like, at all, delivery pizza.

Maybe the pan pizza is better than the thin crust... god it could not be worse!

It only deserves one star for the good service... other than that is the another sub-par overpriced ""gourmet"" pizza joint.

If you want expensive, and good, pizza there are many good alternatives... Pizzeria Bianco, Grimaldi's, etc."
1,"I will never make another purchase from this company ever again! The company tried to deliver damaged furniture to my home and then gave me the run around about processing a refund when I refused to accept the items. After 5 phone conversations, they agreed to refund me for refusing damaged items. I cannot recommend this to anyone."
1,"I do enjoy a good bowl of Pho.   This was -not- a good bowl of pho.

grey chicken meat., off tasting broth, old bean sprouts, 1 piece of a jalepeno pepper... dingy insides.  Weird looks from the server.  I don't think I'll be back.  Not much else I can say"
1,"No no no...do not go here, now I'm not talking about the fact that the place looks crappy, or the bathroom is suspect but the fact that the food is nasty. It was completely empty when we were there and that should have been some indication on what to expect but no I am a glutten for punishment. I ordered some tacos and didn't even finish the meal I ended up just tossing the food and still got a tummy ache from what little I did eat. This place is definitely not a good look"
1,"WOW!  I have never been to a place with service this horrible.  I may have caught them on a bad night, but I'm not giving them a second chance to find out!

I came in with a group of 4.  We stood up front for 5-10 minutes before waving someone down to be seated.  That was a mistake..

As we're waiting for a server to take our drink order, we noticed that EVERY single table had empty cups waiting to be refilled, dirty plates that needed bussing, and people with impatient faces.  There was only 1-2 dedicated servers, and they completely ignored us.

We stuck around just to see how long it would take before someone took our drink order, it was like being in the Twilight Zone.  After 30 minutes and flagging down 3 employees, we just walked out laughing, no one had even apologized for the wait, I'm not sure they even saw us leave!  It was the strangest restaurant experience of my life.

What a joke...

**EDIT**  To their credit, right after I posted this review, I received a message explaining that the Director of Operations would like to amend the situation, even going so far as to include their cell number.  I admit that I feel strange posting such a negative statement amid all the 4 and 5 star reviews, I'm assuming I caught them on a really bad night.  I'll edit this if I ever return to the restaurant, but the fact that someone actually reached out to try to rectify things says something"
1,"Where are the managers????   It took 1 1/2 hours for our meal to come out at 8:15 in the evening.  Items came out at different times so we couldn't all eat at the same time.  The asparagus tempura was inedible because they didn't cut the ends.  Waitress just took it away and did not comp us.  Waitress knew next to nothing about the sushi menu.  She sat and talked with the hostess the entire time instead of waiting on her tables.  Food was WAY over priced, and I couldn't speak to my dinner companions because the music was way to loud.  One of the worst dining experiences in a long time.  Paid $70 for a dinner for 4 and went home hungry.  HORRIBLE!"
1,"I brought my sweet sister in law shopping at this Forever 21 location.  She had a bag full of goodies (several hundreds of dollars worth) from H&M.  She stopped at Forever 21 and  sat her bag on the ground right beside her while she tried on a pair of shoes.  Her H&M bag was stolen during that brief moment that the bag was not in her arms.....and while this certainly was not the responsibility of Forever 21....we were so disappointed in the way the Forever 21 staff reacted. They did not call security, or the police, or even offer any condolences.  They just shrugged their shoulders.  My sister in law did love some of the fashions at Forever 21....but the store was such a mess.  There were clothes all over the floor under each and every rack.  There were way too few staff members working, and many who were working were ""socializing"" with one another instead of helping customers or maintaining the store inventory in a decent fashion. The only employees that were on task were:  1 at the checkout, and 1 at the fitting rooms - there was a band of 5 girls dressing one mannequin while the store was amidst in chaos (including someone stealing bags from other customers)..... So - if you choose to shop at this store - hold on to your bags :)"
1,"ok so here's what they teach:  if you are a good person it is right and good for you to take from others and give it to yourself, because you deserve it and everyone else is a bad person.  Stealing is okay, lying is okay, as long as it is done by you, but for the others, they have no place in society, so pillage and destroy them, it is your right and you will be rewarded for that.  Wow."
1,"I came here at noon during spring break. When I walked in, no one was there. I rang the bell on the counter. No one came out from the back. I waited and rang the bell again. Nobody. I waited and rang the bell a third time. No one. I walked out having been unable to even find an employee much less place an order and try the food. Pathetic."
1,"What's with the cheese?  It isn't even Velveta.  It's liquid cheese food and it belongs somewhere other than on my burger.

$5 burger and fries is a great deal IF -- IF -- it's a great deal.  This is just liquid cheese food on a hamburger patty.  McDonald's will do a burger and fries for $5 that's tastier than this dump."
1,"Avoid this einstein's at all cost. I have been laying in bed puking for over 12 hours because I ate at this garbage dump. The reason I know it was them? My girl is laying next to me puking as well. And the only place we both ate together less than 24 hours ago was there.

The incompetent staff that happens to grace this poorly operating business cannot tell the difference between a large drink and a medium and take over 10 minutes to make two identical sandwiches.

After we got home and ate them, fast forward 6 hours and we are both puking our brains out.

The most common reason for this to happen is when an employee does not wash their hands after getting feces on them. Then they touch my food and I get sick. Based on the staff that day, it does not surprise me one bit.

I would recommend starving over going here. Never again. Now I will go speak to Ralph on the big white telephone some more."
1,The worse food and service. I have never given a bad review. I ordered a shrimp dish with brown rice. The waiter brought out white rice. The sauce was horrible and bland. The calamari salad was not fresh. The dressing was bland too. The waitress checked on us and we asked for check immediately.  She never asked if anything was wrong or if the food was good. I would never recommend or eat here again. The service and food was horrible. I was visiting from out of town and was hoping to get a new experience.  This was not it...
1,"I give this location no love.  We went to this one rather than the one uptown on a Saturday night with a voucher from another location from a bad sushi upchuck experience.  Going late at night with a mostly empty restaurant, we still ended up waiting 10 minutes to be sat, then SHOVED and I mean shoved in next to the only other table in the place - the hostess snickered at me when I kindly asked to move a single table down (really sick of bitchy hostesses in Scottsdale by the way - your job is not that hard so shut up and color for christs sake)  Our waitress took another 10 minutes just to greet us, sushi took forever, and if you can believe it the fun hadnt even begun yet.  
When paying the bill, we present the voucher to the waitress, who says she cant take it.  The manager came over with a bitchy look, basically trying to call it bull shyt and continued to give us the 5th degree about it for the next few minutes - certainly NOT appreciated.  She takes it to the point where she calls the other location where we got it (taking ANOTHER 10 minutes) and finally gives us our bill back - only taking off our 2 rolls and 2 nigiri.  This created one pissed off yelper instantaneously.

Don't bother with this location - you could find bomb shrapnel in your soup and they still wouldnt give a damn.  

And for the sake of all that is holy - STOP WITH THE CRAZY I'M-TOO-SEXY-FOR-MYSELF SCENE!  YOU'RE NOT THAT COOL!"
1,"despite it's billing as the 'largest thrift store in north america,' i'm pretty sure this is the island of misfit goodwill items. the place is huge, but i've never, ever found anything good in this store. i'm not sure how that's possible. but i would never go out of my way to shop here.

i have no bathroom report for this location because i've never been in there long enough to actually go."
1,"Pros: 
-No breed restrictions on dogs
-Washer and dryer in unit

Cons: 
-Awful and idiotic leasing staff. Forms will be missing or prepared incorrectly.
-Rude and inadequate maintenance (be prepared to supply your own tools half of the time)
-Trash divers daily that no one does anything about
-No on-site security (you can call after 9 pm for a ""courtesy patrol"" but it takes them hours to arrive) and the front gate is NEVER closed
-Vandalized cars 
-A MURDER (this was the location of the man who set his pregnant girl friend on fire)
-The main pool is beautifully maintained and clean. The 3 other pools are small, dirty, and frequently closed. 
-Bug infestations in most apartments
-Dogs kept on patios 24/7 (a clear violation of the lease) so their barking can be heard by all
-The basketball court and tennis courts are never available, as they are constantly used by kids to bike ride on with the encouragement of the apartment staff
-Tons of potholes! Driving through the parking lot requires excellent shocks and there is minimal guest parking
-The apartments have less insulation than a cardboard box. Freezing in the winter, sweltering in the summer. Nothing is fitted correctly to it's frame, either. 

If you can afford a better place, I highly reccommend it."
1,We bought or second Jura Compressa coffee machine from Sur La Table.  It was an expensive model priced over $3K.  After 2.5 short months it stopped working.  The only  option they offered was to send it in for repair.  When I asked to have it replaced I was told the turn around was 48 hours.  Its actually 4 -5 weeks when all is said and done.  I high priced item and thats the kind of customer service. Not to mention an expensive product that cant make it 90 days.  Extremely bad customer service on this one.
1,"Would have to agree with Rana A below... I think she said it best

Actually, I had several folks tell me this place was lousy before I went... it even fell below my already low expectations...

Given that I just left the real Barcelona (in Spain)- part of me was truly crying inside that night. OK, I gotta admit- everytime I tell someone I was just in Barcelona (the city) and they say ""you mean the one in Scottsdale"" there is a part of me that wants to just pack my bags and fly back..."
1,"Sadly disappointed.  I've passed Lola's an uncountable number of times and each time thought I needed to try it.  I finally did tonight and was terribly disappointed.  For anyone that has been to Firefly in Las Vegas there is just no comparison.  The sangria was decent but nothing special and the tapas were just ""so so.""  The atmosphere was busy and our service sucked, but it was a very unique and cool environment."
1,"Well, I guess the bar is much lower in Flagstaff, as we went to their restaurant in Glendale for breakfast.  It was less than mediocre.  Starting with the coffee, which tasted awful..it was very bitter and watching the waitress pour old decaffinated coffee into a regular coffee pot! Unacceptable.  I had bacon and eggs...fair. Asked for the hashbrowns to be well done..didn't make a difference, I guess, as they came out raw.  Also, asked that my toast be dry...came out saturated with butter.  My husband had the chicken fried steak with gravy...you could have plastered a house with the gravy!  As you can tell, we will not be returning.  The reason we went, was because of their article in the paper this week.  Just shows, that you can't believe believe everything you read.  My husband, ""jokingly, suggested, that we cancel the paper!"
1,"The only reason 1 star can be given is the flavor choices and taste.  The SMALLEST wings I have ever seen, they must be off of baby chicks.  I thought it was getting punked, actually LOL.  Never to be back"
1,"Bad quality ingredients. I ordered a red curry beef and the beef was awful, hard, I tried to chew it for a minute and decided to give up."
1,"Not worth comin here. I'm all for food like this but this restaurant sucks. They gave me and my dad the wrong meal, and the food was not that good. The meat was dry and the rice was cold. Not worth it."
1,"Boy is the name a temptation.Seriously :)  I'll try to be fair though but I'm writing at a time were this restaurant was truly life changing. So much so that I'm buying a dining room table, additional gear for the kitchen and not frequenting any chain while I'm in my hometown based on the strength of this experience. Even in a good mood this place wouldn't be breaking a 2.5 . I'm not in a good mood.  

Texas cheese fries. Pretty tasteless,mess of uncrisp steak fries that are meant to be Monterrey jack , cheddar and bacon. Either the cheese mixed itself together really well or that's not what I had. Bacon , mm that is a very generous term for the toe nail clippings of meat that ended up atop it. Saving grace was only ordering 1/2 an order.

Kid's meal.  Holy crap dried and scraggly carrots accompanied the most basic hot dog imaginable on the most generic bun. No refill offered this time on drink, no straw either.   By far the most cynical  kid's meal I've met. Sure make a profit but don't take the piss!  Fresh carrots are not hard to do , with white film on them.. sorry you've just earned a  1 star. Should have walked out, didn't. :( 

Entrees.

Cajun steak . Claims to be marinated in spices that I couldn't find. They may indeed have shown them a picture of the process in the recipe but I couldn't find it. Meant to be medium rare but was medium on one side , rare on the other, close though:) 

Sirloin steak. Cooked as requested , a bit over seasoned. 

Sides: Twice baked potato.  If you ever want to open up a salt mine these guy will do it for you. You want an idea of what it's texture was?  Twice chewed would be a better name. Warm vomit with bacon bits would be  a slightly more colorful, and chunky, term.

Fried onions:   came with whatever was stuck to the grill they came from.The mushrooms were the only thing that were as tasteful as expected. They looked very consistent though,  canned?   Never mind they were edible: 

Steak soup,really more a stew,but tasted pretty good.  Overall service was ok'ish but walking the kid to the toilet twice the staff just seemed  to want to get to where they wanted to go and not care for the toddler walking up the aisle to the restroom in front of me.  ( that's for this occasion only , past two times it's been great fun for the kid,)

1.5 rounded to 1 for the carrots."
1,"Oh boy.. I usually LOVE LOVE Mucho Gusto.. but NO ME GUSTA today!

We got a to go order, perhaps that was mistake numero uno.  I got the nachos.. really, you can't mess those up... Or so I thouhgt! I mean Filiberto's would have been a better choice!  Can you say cold soggy mess.. maybe that was my fault. I will accept the blame. I really should have known better. 

Mistake numero dos... What do you call Shrimp Cocktail with out the shrimp?? Bad Service! Lack of quality control....Really.. Really? You forgot the shimp? How do you do that.... Better question WHO DOES THAT?

Mistake numero tres...lemme just say burned tasting chips (as opposed to my soggy nacho chips) and left an acrid taste in ones mouth and the most offending guacamole that I have ever had. 

Let me just say that my co worker and I eat here frequently enough that we can order for each other. We also know to order our guacamole with out the Grand Marnier galze thingy on top.  

Mucho Gusto you mucho FAILED me today.  I hate leaving a bad review without first compaining to management so expect a phone call from me shortly."
1,"My g/f love sushi! She made me a connosiuer of it. and I have to be critical. So many college kids ""love"" RA, but it's mediocre at best.

I'll just list a few things that irk me:
I went during a happy hour with co-workers. It was PACKED. Good thing, right? WRONG!
Extremely poor service. when I went in to meet coworkers who already had a table the hostess told me I have to wait. When I said I have a table, she got in my face. I was tired, long-day and I wanted to chill. I walked past her, found my friends, and she left me alone.
The waitress took quite a bit of time to get around to my table, and the sushi servings were OBVIOUSLY LOW!
I went to Zen 32, and now my choice is SakeBomber. their happy hour servings are much more than RA, and their prices are BETTER!

Be ready for loud noises, as every one is trying to talk louder than the music, and the person next to them.

Just an overall poor experience. and I tip on service. 

Food quality was so-so. Just don't go during a happy hour, which is the only time it's worth it because it's priced so high."
1,"I parked in the Parking Garage, got my parking ticket validated, and still owed money for parking.  The parking validation was worth $3.00.  The charge for parking was $5.00 with $2.00 credit for the validation (not the $3.00 I was promised).  I paid the remaining $3.00 charge, but then, the machine wouldn't give me a receipt.

I am never going back to this location.  It is off my radar from now on."
1,"So a friend of mine went here last Friday, and they were double charged.  The bartender took advantage of the situation and threw out the receipt to avoid cancelling the $60 amount. Which she claims and assumes was her tip (on a $60 bill). ""I get a 100% tips!"" umm..yeah.. I think I will skip this place for sure!"
1,I was accused of training my wife for compensation and was told to leave the gym or he (Page the trainer) was going to call the cops.  I don't know how a trainer confuses me working WITH my wife with training my wife for compensation.    Management handled this issue horribly.   Their lack of attention to the matter showed exactly what a customer of 6 years was worth.   You are treated only as a number.  Do yourself a favor and stay away.  I have since started going to a gym which is much more expensive but worth every penny to be treated with respect.
1,"Sorry Banana Leaf... I'm usually not picky at all but the Thai Curry Tofu and Vegetable dish I picked up last night was awful.  Really... it was almost not edible.  The packaging was not great, so it kind of spilled a bit in the bag - not a good start.

Perhaps the curry is the 'yellow curry' that Jenny R refers to in her review - maybe the chef should taste it before serving it - it was nasty!

Seriously, I've had better Asian food from the food court at the mall before!

I will say, you did listen to my request to add eggplant to the dish - thank you... but if someone requests eggplant, perhaps you should make sure it's cooked fully next time.  I had a bite that was barely cooked - it was crunchy.  

So, needless to say - I don't think I'll be giving you another shot.  First impressions sometimes last a lifetime.  Sorry Banana Leaf!"
1,"Cool place but don't try to arrange a special event. The proprietor was arragont, unflexible and unethical when I held my friend's bachelorette party at The Duce. Be warned!"
1,"Wow.....  Not in a good way

The sashimi was good because all they did was cut it, but that was it.everything else made me wish I went real Chinese! Not Chinese making sushi, culture theives!
P.S. snow crab is not the main ingredient to every roll!"
1,"Food poisoning alert. There is no doubt in my mind that this incident was caused by the order of potato skins I was served at this un-fine dining establishment. First off, the cook looks like somebody off the street, at least wear an apron buddy. 
   Now we are watching the games there and it's about 30 minutes after I eat 4 fairly large skins which I dipped in sour cream and the rumbling in the stomach started. Five minutes later, I was depositing those skins in their tiny toilet and trying to hold on while the games ended. Lastly, another stop was needed on way home to drop off some more skins. This place is full of local drunks, but a good watering hole (yeah literally). Go here to drink and stay away from all food. Also, it was 8 bucks for one order of skins. Why do places charge the same price for apps as they do for sandwiches. It's another sign of a clueless place with poor food and hygiene. Bad choice."
1,"We use to visit this Pub 10 years ago because they had a nice English waitress and excellent fish and chips for the price.  However, we went back a few weeks ago and boy were we disappointed.  The price of the fish and chip dinner went up and they cut the portion in half.  No one assisted us in putting two tables together, we had to do it ourselves.  Two guests wanted a good English hot tea and they didn't brew it in advance, it was just thrown into a small metal tea pot and we had to ask for cream and sugar.  So we've decided there are newer and better places to eat fish and chips, especially up in north Phoenix."
1,"I am a huge tea drinker, so when I found out about Teavana I was excited.  I entered the store and an employee asked if I cared to try some tea. After sampling several different blends, I chose three to purchase.  The employee asked if I wanted to get a large canister for a dollar more than the one I had picked. Not realizing this store sells tea by the ounce rather than per canister, I said ""sure."" He chatted as he filled the containers, never mentioning the price, and once done took my debit card and rang me up. I didn't pay attention to the cost and when I looked at the receipt when I got home my heart nearly stopped. I spent $350 on tea. I returned it and they didn't give me too much trouble. Now I always check the total before handing my card over, and I won't go back. I feel like they totally swindled me."
1,UPDATE: This location is closed. Boo!
1,"Here's the 1. 2. 3...

1. Great Food. I love hot New Mexico style food. Good job.
2. They have a little brewery and make 3 house beers. Unfortunately, they're all shitty.
3. They could REALLY improve the service. No Bueno! 

We'll be back for the food. It might be take out next time though!

4-17-11 Update: Some asshole who was clearly affiliated with Arribas contacted me via private message to slam me for my review. I hope the yelp police find you and pull you off the site. More importantly, I hope more people read my review and stay away from this restaurant. Good Food folks, just get it to go! To Bryan L. and the rest of the gang over at Arribas....Go EFF yourselves! You get one star and NO more of my money!!!!!!! Learn how to work, Kid!"
1,"HORRIBLE---no, NON-EXISTENT customer service!  Which is a shame considering they have good pizza.  I ordered 2 pizzas, wings, a 2 liter and extra ranch; an hour later, the delivery guy showed up with 1 pizza and wings.  When I told him that the order was not complete, he just rolled his eyes and rudely informed me their online ordering was ""messed up"".  Then shoved the pizza and wings at me without apologizing or offering to correct the mistake.  Problem was, I had already been charged for the whole order so I was not about to take less than half of what I paid for.  I told him to cancel the order and he turned and stomped away without another word.  I immediately called the store to make sure I would be credited for my screwed up order that the delivery guy made no attempt to correct.  I asked for the manager when they answered.  The girl who answered said to someone in the background (without putting me on hold so I heard every word): ""Someone wants a manager.  I guess that is you.""  The  ""manager"" told her he didn't have time to talk to customers and proceeded to yell at her about all the work he had to do....uh- FYI buddy, customers are THE REASON YOU ARE IN BUSINESS so it would be a good idea to make time for them!!!! The poor girl came back to the phone after being totally berated by the manager, and I told her what had happened with my order. She offered to credit my card for the order.  Only problem is, it takes 48 hours to process.  So now I am out $40 for the next few days, I have waited over an hour and still have no dinner, and I was treated horribly by not one (delivery driver) but two (manager) Mama Mia employees.  I told the girl on the phone that the delivery guy and manager should not treat customers so rudely, she apologetically agreed.  I asked for the contact information of the owner; if this were my business, I would want someone to let me know if my employees were treating customers like dirt.  She could not provide the contact information but offered to call someone named Frank and have him call me back to resolve the situation.  I never received a call.  Apparently, the ""customers are not important"" tone is set at the top in this business.  There are lots of good pizza places in Phoenix, save yourself the hassle and the headache, order from somewhere that actually knows the meaning of customer service."
1,"I'm sorry. You're too busy to look up my club card information? Too busy too push the button to do the search, enter my phone number and click ok?

I took the time once upon whenever to sign up for your card. And now, you can't take 5 seconds to look it up for me? Let me clue you in, the cashiers here have always looked it up. It always takes 5-10 seconds at most! Great customer service. Insert sarcasm here for the uneducated.

Other Big Lots this hasn't been a problem. Just the one."
1,"pretentious and bad service - attendants are totally clueless (though I feel for them if management makes them wear the costumes they wear). overpriced fashion brands.  if you want to spend $200 on a flannel, there are MUCH better options out there.  run in and glance at the sale rack, otherwise avoid this place like the plague."
1,"Bleh.

Most of us have ventured to the rock at some point in time. It has always been quite awful, but I had some hope after new ownership took over and renovated the place. It is always sad to see a place that has potential, be complete crap.

Upon walking in we were greeted by a small room used as a bar area, with random bar tables along the side. And whales. And scary looking people. And a DJ...well...kinda...he was playing music from a computer..you know...like you would so at home.

We ordered two beers and sat down. Why not give it a chance, right? Just when we thought that things couldn't get worse, we heard a sound. Like a squealing sound. Yes, you guess right, horrible karaoke ON A FRIDAY NIGHT!?!?! Why God, why?????

We chugged our beers and left."
1,"The staff is friendly. But the physical hotel itself itself is comparable to a 2 star motel. The Holiday Express I stayed at is better than this. Priceline tricked me when I requested for a 4 star and indicated that this was a 4 star in name your own price.

Cons:
1) They have cactus in the parking lot where when I got home late, it was dark, poorly lit lot, and opened my car door, step out of the car, and step on to cactus severely injuring my foot to where I can not walk anymore. Who puts low cactus in a dimly lit parking lot where when you get out of a car, someone can step on it? Being injured on vacation is no fun and very painful!
2) hotel room and property is old, like from the 1980s though the front desk boy told me that the rooms were newly renovated
3) Given the previous reviews I asked for a quiet room, but was given a room where the squeeking and thumping and wall shaking, woke me up at 5 in the morning. The neighbors flushing the toilet, showering, and running water can all be heard.
4) the bathroom door is so jammed that it requires both hands, all of my body wait and a few minutes of wrestling with it to open/close it
5) Requested a single bed, however upon arrival, was told that it would be 30/extra a night for a single bed instead of 2 doubles
6) 80s style tube TV 
7) pink 80s decor
8) worn down bed with body dent in it
9) wifi costs 9.99/for 24 hours even though its signal is only 1 bar
10) AC blasts loudly on and off during the night
11) curtains are cut half way so tons of light comes in to the room in the morning. 

pros: 
1) location
2) staff smiles and says hi
3) cleaning staff does a good job"
1,Was I there on a bad day or what?  I showed up 15 minutes after they opened and EVERY item I tried was either luke warm or cold.    They have 15+ items on the lunch buffet and I tried a bite of all of them.   Gross and bland.   I felt sick to my stomach after I left because I kept thinking how bad the food was. Yuck!
1,"Not recommended if you're not white. For me, it's the third time somebody threw out racial slurs at my group. I am beginning to think the place is for rednecks and the like. D&B bowling lanes are better."
1,"I guess this is an east coast/midwest thing because I really don't get it. I'm not a picky eater and I HATE wasting food and money, but I could not finish my plate. I ordered french toast and I was not aware that my french toast was going to be deep fried. Seriously, when I put my fork through it, a piece of fried toast hit me in the eye. My husband was also not impressed with his food. If someone would like to suggest something delicious on the menu that I should try, please let me know because I currently want to vomit every time I see a Chompie's."
1,"Qver-priced, substandard food.  Never met a cheeseburger I didn't like-- until now, (NOT a 1/2 lb.).   Small portions of tired, room temperature ""fry-pieces"",  burnt bacon, chicken tenders so hard, they couldn't be penetrated with a fork.  Mediocre service;  didn't bring kids meal cookie.  Waste of $$$!"
1,I love how all other Yelpers reviewing this company have discovered the same issues that would never permit me to use their services again. Company is a disaster and should be reported to the BBB.
1,"First of all, if you go here, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make sure you check your bill when it comes!  honestly.  We went here 3 times.  all 3 times we were over charged....  either the menu's were out of date, or we were ""past happy hour time"" (BS)... oh and the other excuse... we just changed our menu.  blah blah blah  P

then they always have to ""get a manager"" to come to the table, which takes forever!  (I am sure they hope we leave)  PLUS! THE SERVICE SUCKS ASS!!!!  this is a definitely bait and switch!

1st time it happened we just dealt with it, and was like, whatever...

2nd time it happened, my daughter who just got back from deployment (Navy) wanted to do something special for us and took us all there.  My husband looked at the check and noticed it wasy CRAZY over what we thought as we were there for happy hour.  The waitress had to get the manager which took over 20 minutes, (gimme a break)  finally we took a 30 dollar gift card because we were so sick of 'arguing about it.  We discussed it about 20 minutes and we were finally like, whatever...

3rd time...  took a friend there.  again we ordered devils ale.  on the menu it was listed at one price... when we got the bill, it was almost twice as much.  We waited for our server to come back, she never did, she totally ignored us.  I gave her a dollar tip (which is NOT like me, i tip very well, too well)  and I wrote on the recept why she got such little money as a tip.  

If you are looking for a fun time go caddy corner to San Filepe's  that place is fun and the staff are friendly and fun.  We much prefer there, we wll never go to Caddilac Ranch again.  They say 3rd time is a charm, Well, it is... its a charm to know you are overspending and its a big gimmick and they dont give a crap!

oh and if i didn't have to give a star, i wouldn't have."
1,"I think they need to hire a better chief; the food doesn't taste right.

My mom said she can teach them how to cook for free."
1,"My friend kept telling me how good their lunches are... I tried it, but it didn't do anything for me.  The sandwich tasted like something you can get at Safeway, but twice the price.  For being called a Purveyor of Fine Foods, I expected the food to taste like not just any ordinary sandwich. 

What I had:
Ham, cheese with portobello mushrooms on a panini with 2 sides of pasta, one was parmesan and the other was macaroni. Maybe it was the panini bread. I think the parmesan pasta was made there, but I know for sure the macaroni was not made there, it tasted like something I had at a picnic which was in a carton. It wasn't anything to brag home about. 

I found out the head chef made my sandwich... keep him in the kitchen and away from the customers, no personality whatsoever. I asked for his suggestion, and his reaction was ""anythings good."" 

Normally, when I go to AJ's, I go for their desserts. Their desserts are fabulous and you can get individual servings at a reasonable price.  I can take an assortment home and have them for later. 

Our company does use them for their catering and I've had many compliments on their dishes, but pass on the lunches."
1,"I don't expect much when grabbing lunch at a mall, but I expect better than this.  The seaweed salad was a generic overly soy tasting disappointment, the rainbow roll was barely worth eating - the shrimp on the roll tasted fishy, the fish was mealy-textured, and the rich was soft and too sticky.  The yellow tail roll suffered from the same, and we luckily were cautious enough not to try sashimi.  The miso soup was served barely like warm.  The tea was served barely luke warm. That was when we finally got service, which took a veritable eternity.  Tea refills?  Good luck on getting someone's attention for that.

The inside is a dismal, cavernous sport-bar/pool hall sort of feel.  Basically no redeeming features here."
1,"I wish they had a ""0"" star option too!

The service and food was awful. Just a bunch of kids running the place.  The place closes at 10pm but when we went in there at 8pm all the workers were too busy cleaning to go home early to help us.  The food was burnt  on one side and raw on the other. The manager was too busy flirting with the other help. We couldn't get drinks because all the glasses where dirty, we were told by our waitress. We asked for the manager before we left at 8:45 and was told he already went home for the evening. What kind of manager leaves a bunch of teenager to run the place? 

NEVER GOING BACK!!!!"
1,This place is closed.  Good riddance.
1,"I had one of the worst experiences of my vegetarian life here. I had been to Johnny Rocket's before and gotten the vegan option so I knew I would be ok going here. I was out with my meat eating sister and my pescatarian husband so I figured this place would be the best for all three of us to get what we want. 

We get in and I ordered a burger that wasn't the Streamliner (1st mistake), and just ordered it with the BOCA burger. The waitress takes our order, my husband also ordered his with a BOCA. 

About 20 minutes later the food comes out. The patty looks right. I was a little apprehensive and I should have gone with my gut feeling on not eating here this day, but I ignored it. It had been awhile since I had eaten a BOCA patty (over a year), so I THOUGHT it looked right. (2nd mistake)

I start eating it and about half way through it the bill hits our table. It was crowded in there so the waitress must have been trying to get us out of there. So I look at the bill and notice both my husband and my burgers say Turkey substitution. I immediately start to freak out. We call the waitress over and explain to her that we ordered BOCA, why does it say Turkey? She then tells us that it is BOCA it just says turkey. I say, no that doesn't sound right. So she goes to talk to her manager I guess because we never saw her again. The manager comes over to our table and apologizes profusely for what happened. I'm upset because how the hell do you confuse BOCA and Turkey? I mean, really. I know some people might think how did I not know the difference. And I thought that to myself as well, but the truth is it slipped by me even though it shouldn't have. And it hurts me every time I think about it. I will never come to this Johnny Rockets again, if any of them ever again because of this experience. 

All I can say is, if you are vegan or vegetarian, and you go to any of the Johnny Rockets, make sure that your waitress/waiter knows that a BOCA burger isn't meat. Stress that to them. Because obviously they aren't trained to know what the difference is."
1,"I just thought I'd post an update.  I planned never to go back, but was with a friend who really wanted one of their breakfast items.  I skipped ordering ANY food whatsoever and merely ordered coffee and watched her eat.  As fate would have it, she had a BACK HAIR in her scrambled eggs (we are 2 for 2 now).  My gag reflex is going off as I type this.  My husband, friends, and I have renamed this place the Black Hair Diner, and we've decided they have actual black bears cooking in the kitchen, since they can't seem to keep black hairs out of their food."
1,"When I was in highschool various clubs used to sell Karsh's bagels around campus to raise money. I would buy a bagel and cream cheese and hide it in my backpack to munch on during class. Soooo good!
 I was feeling nostalgic one day and decided to pop in for a bagel and cream cheese. 
The guy behind the counter was nice enough, I told him my order which came to $2.95 or something just barely under $3.  I had failed to notice the sign which said they do not accept credit cards for purchases under $3. I apologized and said I didn't have any cash and offered to run the the ATM.  The guy behind the counter very nicely asked other lady behind the counter  (the owner? manager on duty maybe?) if she would let me use my card. She looked right at me all stink-eyed and said ""No"" and returned to what she was doing. No apology, no ""I'm sorry but there is an ATM at so and so...."" Very curt. 
Thanks a lot personality plus! I will not be returning and I hope you choke on a matzo ball. 
Shame too, I loved those bagels."
1,"We went here for Mother's Day based on the positive reviews and had a pleasant experience.  Good food, good service, good ambiance.  We came back here for Father's Day and had a very unpleasant experience; the worst display of management I have ever encountered!  Apparently our order was never put in from the server or there was some sort of ""computer malfunction' they claimed, but we waited at the table for 45 minutes after ordering, no food, nothing.  The server obviously recognized the mistake and kept checking in with us and apologized for the unusually long wait, (did I mention the restaurant was half empty, I wonder why!) and she did offer to comp our coffee drinks.  But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait, she came over to our table, did not properly introduce herself, sat down and pointed to the man-held computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes.  Really?!?  You're coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting???  It was so rude and disrespectful, she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!!  It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager.  I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake.  She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation, but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that! 

 Needless to say, unless this restaurant starts to provide better training to their managers and team members, or hires a new manager, we will NOT be coming back here again."
1,"Coffee-meh. Not great, not horrible.
Scone-dry.
Service-ridiculously slow.
The night we were there (8/11), the owner came and asked a group of people (who were clearly having some sort of meeting) to stop talking because they were ""disturbing the guitar player."" Chased 8 paying customers (at least I assume they were paying customers; they all had drinks) out the door. Weird!! Don't think I'll be going back."
1,"I just had the ice cream. That was when I didn't know where to go for ice cream. It tasted artificial, much like how everything else looked. There was also a weird feeling about the place - too self-consciously ""cute""  suspension of reality - almost as if a crime was imminent like a bad TV show. Looking at the rest of the food was almost disturbing - like school cafeteria food, only worse. Oh well, it discouraged me from eating anything the whole rest of the day."
1,"Okay, did I say bad??
WORSE.
Negative five stars.

From San Diego,
1. they made us wait in line for ticketing.
2. Made us go check our bags

3. Bag agent told us the flight has been delayed 35 min and we have to wait in the ""special needs"" line bc we were gonna miss our connection flight. 

4. Booked another flight. Meanwhile got barked at my a brainless, incompetent, mean lady that was a complete b*tch to us.
She told us there was plenty of time for our next flight and that we should patiently stand in line (and miss that flight).

5. Got on the runway. Plane circled around for about an hour. didn't take off.
6. ""mechanical problems"".
7. kept ppl on the plane for another hour.
8. kicked everybody off saying we weren't taking off on this plane.

9. made everybody wait in a long@$$ line that didn't move while we saw a ticketing agent to rebook our flight (while I held up a DELTA SUCKS sign made with pen and crayon on my sketchbook)

10. hours later after not knowing what to do with us, they placed us in a hotel in downtown SD.
11. We were to take an 8 PM flight the next day to LAX and then 2 hr and 45 min layover.
12. 11:45 PM plane from LAX to Tokyo.... scheduled 4 AM landing in the far east, you kidding me? 
13. THEY LOST MY LUGGAGE. 

~~*~*~*~*~*~*~* another incident:

LAX to Tokyo: ""mechanical problems""
stayed another hour on the plane.
Had them shuttle us to a hotel in the middle of nowhere.
Lost luggage on the way there. It fell out of a bus!

Next morning, 8 AM plane to Busan, Korea.

Seriously, you expect me to go to work on Monday after all this sh*t?!
Sorry Delta, I'm so exhausted, sick and tired of you.
F*CK YOU guys and your incompetence and sh*tty customer service  too."
1,This store is banking on the hope they are the only place to buy what they are selling. The mgr at the cash register was not only snobbish and unhelpful but down right rude. It is 12/21/12 I know Christmas time is tough for retail employees but I was at many other retail stores today and their mgrs and employees were extremely friendly. I spend approx 1/2 hour talking to a sales assoc who was very friendly and all was good until I got to register with the mgr and I ended up walking out without purchasing anything. I then went to my car and purchased desired items on amazon while in this stores.parking lot. I know business is good this time of year and maybe this companies business is always good. But the post office and Sears also used to be the king! I could explain all the facts of the situation but I am sure it would make no difference as I am confident this is the culture of this store.
1,"Cheap!  Cheap!  Beware!  If you order Chicken McNuggets from this McDonald's they will charge you 10 cents for each sauce packet over the alloted quantity.  Either go to another McDonald's where they don't charge, go to another restaurant that values your business and NOT nickel and dime you to death or don't eat!"
1,"Just isn't very good.

I don't understand why people give this place even three stars.  It's rare for me to give a place a low rating, but, My Big Fat Greek restaurant is nothing but gimmick anymore and has gone from bad to worse.   The food is not even close to any representation of what good Greek food tastes like.

I've been to this place several times over the years.  This location and others.   It used to be just on the lower end of OK...  it's never been as good as you can get from a 'Ma and 'Pa place.  However, we went for lunch the other day and it's just gotten to the point I wouldn't even go back for a quick bite.

We ordered the garlic hummus, and it was overly full of garlic and not home made.  It seemed to be loaded with garlic powder, as opposed to fresh hummus that just had roasted garlic in it.   The olives we ordered were rough at best.  UGH even thinking about them.  Overly seasoned and not very fresh.   The rice was over cooked and was so soft it lacked any sort of texture.

The first rule of good let, alone great food, is FRESH.   This place needs a rescue.

Less critical, but, I think an overall representation of what has happened to the place, the menu's were totally trashed.   As in ratty, tattered, and dirty.  The lamination was coming off them and they were dirty. 

Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."
1,"I was searching for a unique item to give as a Thank You gift and I stopped by Practical Art over the Labor Day weekend after viewing some items on their website.  I was extremely under underwhelmed by the service I received and do not plan on returning.  

When I arrived the young woman behind the counter was having a personal conversation with an acquaintance.  Besides the employee and her conversation buddy the store was empty.  I spent about ten minutes looking around and the young woman did not have the common courtesy to acknowledge me with a simple ""Hello"", even as I was viewing items directly in front of the counter.  When I was leaving the store she did break long enough to say ""Bye"".

I believe it is very important to support local business but I will not spend my money here.  I did find several items I wanted to buy and made note of the artist. I have done the extra leg work to reach out to them to find out how to purchase their items through other channels.  I do not feel they should miss a sale due to the sub par customer service at this location."
1,"Forget the yogurt and the berry berry bad service. The OCD worker with shadow you and serve you a sample with a glaring stare. You'll never feel so ackward adding your toppings since she'll trail behind you and fix the spoons. Yogurt sucks as much as the service, so I don't recommend."
1,"I haven't yelped in about 2 months, and I was waiting for a place to either wow me or disgust me.  Well, this place was that bad. 

First impressions were all right -- the outside bar was neat w/ good views of downtown, and the fire pits were nice.  No beers on tap though; and seriously, what's with the hip-hop club DJ at 7:00 pm?  Come on guys, way too early for that.

It wasn't too long before three of us were seated; and after about 10 minutes, our waitress came up and asked us whether we were ready to ... oh wait, that's right, no menus yet, good job.  O.k., so I ordered the Thai Spring rolls, which had a filling of lettuce, a single strip of carrot, and noodles.  Seriously?!  Main course, I ordered the curry, which turned out to be the worst curry in the world -- I don't even know if it was curry; it was more like a bowl of thick, yellow soup, with a few pieces of chicken and a couple of vegetables tossed in.  Yuck.  And then they only gave me a tiny bowl of rice.  I'm sorry, isn't it supposed to be the other way around?  My friends completely agreed with how bad the place was (I think they had some sort of stir fry, which they said was bland and pointless).

So yeah, I don't recommend this place.  Instead, head a block over to The Roosevelt for some good beer on tap and some pretty good food."
1,"I will be moving to Phoenix in the Winter and I thought I'd scout out some LFS while I was visiting, which led me to Reef Culture. At first I was positive seeing some nice looking displays and LED use, however this soon changed.

 On closer inspection, lots of the tanks were infested with aiptasia and bubble algae, and prices of coral were hugely inflated compared to other prices in the area and back home. The people were very unprofessional and unfriendly and first ignored me entirely despite trying to flag someone down. When I did manage to get their attention, I was belittled and treated like a child who knew nothing about the hobby (I have had marine tanks for over a decade ranging from large 55 gallon+ to tiny DIY LED picos). 

After this rude and demeaning experience, I continued to peruse the last few tanks and came across an angler fish. I watched him and he followed me as I walked down the isle as far as his tank would go and I backtracked a couple steps, amused that he was slowly walking along the tank with me. There was a loud crack as the man behind the counter slammed the phone down, snapped his fingers at me, and told me to ""stop harassing the fish."" Keep in mind, I was not tapping on glass or prodding anything as I am quite short and I could barely reach to the high up tank where the angler fish was, much less reach to ""harass"" any fish. After this rude treatment I promptly left. This kind of unprofessional treatment of the customers is shocking and unacceptable, not to mention the bubble algae infested tanks (one spore of that on the water that you get your coral in and your tank is infected too). 

I won't be doing business here when I move."
1,"I don't know what's up with Eddie??? I always found him to be pleasant, and really taking care of the customers. However on the 17th of November we had a birthday party of 19 people, and they gave us one waitress. We sat down at 7:00 pm and our main course came at 9:15. No real big deal but one person can't handle a table of 19, and we were having fun. So one of the guest's had ordered the $12.00 burger along with a salad and told the waitress no Mayo because he can't stand it at all. The burger comes out and it has Mayo on it, and he tells the waitress. She was not at fault, and had written it down clearly. He asked for a new one, and she comes back and say's Eddie cooked the hamburger and refused to cook a new one but would make him a new bun. He didn't want that because he hates Mayo that much, so there was no problem taking it off the tab, but Eddie would not make a new one. LOL. What's up Eddie??? I don't understand at all, you take it off the bill because you screwed up, but refuse to make another burger that you would have been paid for.  Then you end up looking like a fool in front of the other eighteen people. My daughter has even taken one of your classes, and said what a great guy you are. Really, Really bad PR that night and the next birthday party wont be at Eddie's House. Great time that night, but the ending leaves a very bad taste in 19 people's mouth."
1,"The organization is grand with a ton of selection but the employees could care less about costumer service. 

It is very amazing with the amount of unemployed people in the city they have to hire the most incompetent individuals.... 

I'm not going to be ignorant and say they are ALL bad, but a few in the bunch seem to make it difficult to be a repeat costumer. 

Try talking to a manager at this location and you will be routed around the store till you finally get some one that states ""the manager is off till next week."" 

i will stay a website purchaser until they change their policy at this location and hire individuals with a better standard"
1,"Hands down, the single worst public mass transit system I have seen ANY PLACE I have ever lived or traveled to (and I am an avid world traveler). 
I've been riding this system on and off (I vaccilate between non-Phoenix-metro cities and here a lot) for roughly 10 years, and yeah, for a few of those years I would also drive a car here and there, so I have a sound basis of comparison. 

This is a joke compared to other cities in the USA (and abroad) that have equivalent populations. Hell, in NYC and LA, it's SOOO much easier to get around even though those places are larger and more densely populated. Phoenix is easily 30 years behind every other city-size comparable mass transit system that's out there. Get with the times!

We need: busses that run MORE than once per 1/2 hour (and that's at it's current fastest), busses that are ON TIME (DAILY, they are never on time. Always way too early without waiting, or way too late without apology), more stops, stops that have actual BENCHES or SHADE or POSTED INFORMATION of any kind. I cannot even imagine how travelers get around on this thing, nothing is ever posted with any relevant info or signage.

Etc, etc, etc.
But seriously, just god awful and a complete joke to anyone who has ever experienced public transport anywhere else."
1,Shocked this place has 4 stars. First off you can always tell if a Mexican food place is good based on the beans and the salsa. Well guess what both suck! Eat at el molino's and you will never come here again!
1,"Terrible service--they replaced my phone screen and it broke within 2 wks. Phone was not dropped or mishandled, just cracked and ""owner"" would not honor their warranty. They only accept cash--that should be a red flag if you are considering a business like this!"
1,"Closed on Sunday?  Looks like you've not only lost my Sunday dollars, but my business on Monday through Saturday too."
1,"I eat a lot of Asian food (of different sorts).  Asian is actually my go-to cuisine since I have a lot of food allergies.  This place deserves a thumbs-down, unless you love Americanized Asian.  The food was bland, breaded and just not worth any money.  Next time I'm in Phoenix, I definitely won't eat here."
1,"If you like sushi, go somewhere else. I was extremely disappointed in the quality of both the service and the food. 

I decided to take my family here because the other reviews seemed good; however, either my experience was an anomaly or the other Phoenix yelpers and I have stark differences in taste.

The staff had great smiles, yet lacked follow through. We had to ask for water and extra ginger twice. The sushi rolls were the flimsiest I have ever seen! Although poor in quality, they were high in price for what they serve. I'm not sure about the names of some of their rolls...one was named ""Climax."" Gross and just distasteful.  

The decor and ambiance leave you wanting. They have three different wallpapers hanging and the music is overwhelming. 

Even though this is the only sushi bar in Surprise, I will gladly drive to Peoria or Scottsdale the next time I have a craving for sushi."
1,"One star would be giving it a holiday gift!

For me Copper Star Coffee Shop has been a place where consistency and pride is taken in their food and presentation. Unfortunately, Circle H BBQ is nothing like the prior statement.

My first visit to Circle H BBQ centered on ordering a half slap of ribs. They were extremely over-cooked.  There was more charcoal on the top, back and ends that was just not editable.  Once you scraped away the charcoal, on the tops, ends and the center ribs, there was one that was eatable. 

The company offered me a second chance to try their food, by giving me a complementary full slap.  Nothing had improved.
They say they smoke the ribs, but there was no odor to that effect. In face the ribs I ordered the second time spend over 20 minutes on the grill after the order was placed.
Btw...the waitress at the front counter couldn't even tell be the type of rub on the ribs and the type of cut they were. When I asked if they were smoked (cooked) daily, she said some are if you get here early - others were from the refrigerator from last night. The so called ""dry-rub"" seasoning was tasteless. The BBQ sauce is major strange!

The bottom line is the ribs were not worth the cost they were charging. ($14/Half for 6 bones and $26/Whole 12-13 bones both with sides) I have high hopes for the brisket, but it might be a while untill I try that endeavor.

Overall if they don't change the way they 'burn"" the ribs, run, run or drive real fast to another place.  The charcoal is not good for you and there is lots of it!

Honey Bears, My Mothers or even driving to Famous Dave's is well worth the trip.
Sorry to burst your bubble, I too, had high hops for a centrally located rib place.  

I'm still waiting."
1,"This has to be the worst restaurant in terms of hygiene. Two of my friends had food -poisoning after having dinner here. The food is just unhealthy with tons of oil floating on the top of curries, and I am not sure if any health/hygiene code is followed here. 
The service is poor and the information on its website is incorrect, the owner does not allow dine-in after 9 or 10 even though it says that the restaurant is open till 11. 

One night I saw the owner cleaning the place without gloves and she was nice enough to give us a to-go parcel without cleaning her hands (great example to the servers!). I had a peek inside the kitchen when the door was ajar, and it definitely looked dirty.

I have been a lot of hole-in-the-wall places around this restaurant, including Haji Baba, the Vietnamese place and others, but neither any of my friends nor I have fallen sick coz of the food. If you need a spicy-food fix, i strongly recommend you do not try this place, lest you want a visit to the doctor the very next day."
1,"Ok Im giveing Del Taco one more chance....

I go in what is your best chicken Idem....

um Burrito or taco? he asks

Have you had the Burrito?

no....I haven't had ethier...

Have any one eaten anything here? I ask the rest of the resturant crew....they All shake there heads no....

ok so even if the food was discounted or free no one should ever eat del taco.....regardless I did eat a burrito.....

and my worst fears where confirmed....I could have dumpster dove at a taco bell and gotten better food......

Feed me bad food once, shame on you.....Feed me bad food 4 times Shame on ME...."
1,"if you like terrible service and overpriced food you've come to the right place.  If I knew before I went in there I would be paying $16.00 for macaroni and cheese, and had the pleasure of waiting around for an hour to get it, while my glass remained empty, I would've stayed away (which is what you should do).  Food wasn't awful, although 2 members of the party did cut up their mouths eating the hard as a ""Rock"" bread on their sandwiches. The mac n' cheese was nothing special.  The service was beyond poor.  First and last time I will eat at Hard Rock Cafe."
1,"I was excited to go to the lululemon athletica at Scottsdale Quarter because I really enjoyed shopping at the previous store that closed in Scottsdale. Well something has changed... I walked into the store and while there were more sales clerks than customers, no one said a word to me and no one asked if I needed any help. They were all too busy talking with one another. And to add insult to to injury... one clerk had to walk around me (didn't ask if I needed help) and went to play with one of the customers dogs.... I had fully intended to buy a Christmas gift there, but left because the service was so poor and I did need help with the sizing.   I went over to the Nike store and had a totally different experience, very positive.  I'll stick with Lucy and Nike where they appreciate their customers."
1,"If we were able to give 0 stars... I would ask to give -1.

I live nearby, and am sad to see that a coffeeshop that sells coffee this horrible is still in business in my neighborhood.

Not only was the breve mocha that I ordered disgusting, so was the process of watching the barista make my drink.

They use hershey's chocolate from a dirty nacho cheese style pump with chocolate sauce dripping down the sides, and coagulated into a thick cap at the tip of the nozzle.  *Disgusting.  

The espresso shot was made without care, or concern for the fact that it was done way too quickly, and with espresso grounds that were ground way before I walked in the door.  Possibly way before the barista started her shift.   *Gross

And finally.  The milk.  She steamed the milk with the automatic steam wand.  This was a huge red flag.  Those are notorious for burning milk and making disgusting drinks.  Well, both were accomplished. 

The steam wand was tinted white from lack of cleaning.  And the worst part was that near the end of the wand was a DARK CHEESE that had accumulated from burning milk and not cleaning the wand after every use. 
Which is FREAKIN - DISGUSTING.

I wasted 5 bucks on an overpriced small mocha, and threw it away after taking a sip.  

Hundreds of businesses in the area close down every year, and there are more realty signs in strip malls in this neighborhood than actual storefronts.  AND I really don't understand why this place hasn't joined the many defunct businesses and starry eyed entrepreneurs in the unemployment line.  

If you own a coffeeshop.  Coffee should be your passion.  
If you own a bait shop.  Fishing should be your passion.
If you just want to open up a business that mirrors a nearby popular chain (short, tall, grande), please stop wasting space in the strip mall and get a day job in a cubicle.

Never going back, warning my friends about this place, and am probably going to contact the health department on Monday."
1,"Place is alright but for the waitress, poor service and things sent over we didn't order.  We sent them back but had  additional items brought and not brought on the tab anyway.  She said me ""that couldn't happen"" and refused to take it off. Waitress included autograt. 

I have been here a dozen times and never get great service but enjoy myself.  This time will be my last."
1,"New N. Scottsdale location, Baaaaaaad!  The were 10 staff members milling around and there was no manager on sight.  $10.00 for a mediocre burger, with an uncooked, tasteless bun not large enough to encompass all the arugula.  They forgot the sauce, which apparently is the main ingredient.  The upgrades are ridiculous.  $1.00 here for cheese on an already ""well priced"" burger (btw Flemings blue cheese/bacon burger $6, best in town), $5,00 here for fries.  C'mon.  And, it's the same two hispanic guys, who don't have any idea about chef inspired food, cooking in the kitchen as every other restaurant, there is no chef For the price, you want to see the chef/owner representing, especially at a new location, and, you want competent staff who treats you as #1, and not their conversing with the other staff members as #1, and you want to enjoy what is supposed to be one of the best burgers in town!  What a disappointment.  The lack of top down management care and supervision carries through in all elements of the poor experience.  Take a pass."
1,"It saddens me to say that this isn't the worst Mexican restaurant we've eaten at, that's on Oahu near Waikiki beach, but it's close. 

 Damn it we had to drive by Arriba's to get to this place. 

  I had a chimichanga that was a little anemic, though what there was of the filling was ok,  beans  tasteless, rice looked the part but as spicy as your average UK meal involving boiled meat and root vegetables.

 Erin's Fajita salad was similarly lack luster  with  all the appearance of being tasty yet   bland chicken. Usually, unless there's an attempt at ""chefing"" as opposed to cooking  I'll order a basic dish ( I don't shoot the chef though  and trust me these guys are safe from Agent Sands , very safe)  for the first time out  and if the beans/rice suck.. no return.

Overall It feels like aliens, space ones, are running the place and they learned cooking from pictures.  It's certainly a mistake we won't be repeating."
1,"Maybe I ate at a different restaurant than the other people, or once they got through the ""soft opening""  they gave up, because this place was not good.

The service was mediocre at best, they seemed scattered and unfocused, took five minutes to get water.  I gave up on ordering anything else after that.

The food?  Bland hamburger, that was cooked perfectly in the center.  Too bad that outside of the center inch it was completely overcooked and dry.  Soggy duck fat fried and average sweet potato fritters.  

Let's talk about this ""coal oven"".  While the burgers are cooked in a coal oven, you could tell by the smoke hanging over the restaurant, they are cooked in an iron skillet i.e. pan fried!  The coal adds absolutely zero to the burger.

Overall, if I am going to spend $10 on a burger with no sides, it better be perfect, and this wasn't.  I would also hope $5 would get me more than two fritters."
1,"I have been here a few times over the last 4 years and really liked it.  It was horrible on Saturday night (5/28).  I ordered the enchiladas with chicken.  When it arrived there were 3 tiny enchiladas with an ounce of cheese inside the soggy tortillas and the ""with"" chicken part apparently meant a few chunks of chicken would be tossed on top.  I was so disappointed, but starving so I ate it.  The guacamole was really disappointing too.  I don't think we will go back again."
1,"I keep wanting to like this place.  I want to support a local business, and yet....

Last year I took my two boys there after a theater performance (Greasepaint!   Excellent!), and after we placed our orders for lunch, I took out our SET game (it's a card game that does not use a traditional deck - great fun).  WIthin moments, the server was back at our table.  ""You can't do that.""  ""What?  Play cards?  It's not gambling."" (Maybe I was wrong, but living here, you start to assume that an objection to something must be religion based).  ""The owners don't allow it.""  ""They don't allow it?  It's a matching game.""  ""No.  You'll have to put it away.""

Now.  I would understand not wanting us to sit and play cards if we'd finished eating and were just holding a table (assuming it was busy).   However, this was during the gap between ordering and eating.  I KNOW I should've just left then.  Instead, I made my kids happy and we stayed for lunch (and ice cream!).  

A couple months ago I (foolishly) decided to try again.  Didn't bother with the cards this time.  The lousy thing this time was the mold on my son's bread.  They DID remove the sandwich from the bill, but eish.    

I'd kind of like the ""Restaurant Impossible"" guy to come in here and give it an overhaul.  I don't mind the nostalgia stuff, but the place does need a solid going over."
1,"Rental car review.

118 degrees.  Standing outside in the heat waiting for a bus.  10 minutes go by and I have seen 3 busses leave with out of service signs.  Another 10 minutes pass and no active duty busses.  Finally, a bus!  We have a packed bus and the driver is just standing outside.  5 minutes later he comes back on the bus and we drive 10 miles an hour the whole way to the terminal.

PHX...pay attention.  Business travelers do not appreciate being left in the heat for 20 minutes watching out of service busses pass by."
1,"Why can't the attendant understand a simple direct question?

Can someone please tell me just where the Hell I'm supposed to put my freakin' drink?

and worst of all ... my balls don't fit in this place.

*one extra star for the bartender offering me her personal lighter 
*minus the extra star for not having any matches"
1,"1 star for service and attitude.The food was delicious , but the staff was very hateful. I am writing this review. I don't remember the waitresses name but I do remember that she was short , hispanic , and she was pregnant at the time. She was incredibly hateful.So hateful and rude to me and my parents. I do know why she did this is because I am transgendered. I was wearing leggings and I was carrying a black polo purse. 

So I thought that this happened because of how I was dressed and how I looked , but that really wasn't the case.I went back 2 weeks later and I dressed differently. More ""manly"" (ha). Different waitresses , same great food , same hateful attitudes. I will stress to everyone reading this to save your time and money and go to a different pizza hut or a different pizza joint to get better service."
1,"We came there on November 5, 2011 and the service was very bad. The worst I have ever seen and we were treated like shit. We came into town from LA and Vegas for the NFL game and seen Mrs. White's cafe on Foodnet Work and knew the food had to be great. The chicken was great, but the customer service was so bad we will never return again.  We got a refill on our drinks and the guy poured sum of our drinks on the left overs so we could not take our food back to the hotel. Foodnet Work shame on you for recommending this place. Just because the chicken is good, does not mean you treat people like shit. 

We had to remind the staff over six times to get our order. We waited over 40 minutes to get the other 3 pieces of chicken to finish our meal. We don't mind waiting but it was pretty rude when you are watching other peolple are getting their meals when they walked in after us. The Mac and Cheese did not look like everyone else's order- it look like it came out of a box. You can tell it was far from homemade, it cleary was not bake, no crust. The gravy was watered, missing favor. Corn bread was over cooked under salted. The cornbread sure as  hell did not look like everyones else's cornbread. I felt like we received the leftovers. 

Truly the worst service we ever received. The place needs to learn how to be respectful and just be nice."
1,This is the closest to a New York hipster style coffee shop I've seen in Arizona.  They serve beer too.  Problem is that the espresso was unbelievably bitter.  Cookie happy hour is pretty cool though.
1,"I wish I could rate this place higher but my blow out is terrible. I asked for a blowdry with lots of volume and curl. It seemed that the cross between the mai-tai and cosmo would be perfect. My hair is flatter than what I walked in with. My hair is curly naturally so has decent volume, but for some reason its flat! Also the stylist pulled my hair alot while blow dryng and apologized for hurting me which I appreciated, but have never experienced with a blowdry before. I don't think I'll be coming back, sad since I love the concept and the salon is lovely.

Update: They offered me a make up blow out. I decided to try the place out again, thinking it was a fluke that my blowdry was so awful. Mistake! Not only was my second blowdry here mediocre, I ended up paying for the service. I wrote to their manager who had offered the complimentary blowdry, but no response."
1,"Last night on my way home from work I figured I would pick up some dinner for me and my wife who is taking care of our newborn all day and has little time to cook for us. I ordered chicken limone the menu says serves two to three and we don't eat a lot so I figured it would fill us up. The price was 18.99 but I figured in a family style Italian place and we should have plenty of food. 

I was handed my bag and I was sure it was the wrong order because it was so light so I checked it in the car and was shocked. 

I see three small pieces of chicken in a big container with a small piece of bread and that's it! 

So I figured they just forgot the pasta and went back in and asked the hostess and she said yes it comes with it then said no after thinking about it. 

So how can they justify that price? It was so small there was no way it would feed 2 people so I had to cook pasta at home and then reheat our chicken in the microwave.

I worked in the service industry for years and this place is a joke! 

FYI just because there's people with money who live near your restaurant doesn't mean you can tailor your food prices to their income level without delivering value.........if you sell crap in the worst neighborhood that same crap should be priced the same in a affluent neighborhood....same crap different place.

No value means lost customers ...."
1,"I had high hopes for this place, and it is really too bad because I love to support the Phoenix area restaurants, especially a Caribbean one and I had already been to the adjoining Rum Bar and loved the drinks, but the food was bad.  It was not only bad, but by all means avoid the daily market catch.  It was not fresh at all!  Very over priced!  For nearly $25 for a simple white fish they could have at least taken the bones out of the thing.  It tasted like it had been sitting around all day (or two) in its own juices, and when I let the waiter/bartender know he just ignored it and then ignored us until we left.  I will never be back for the food.  The Rum flights are worth a trip there, but that is it."
1,"Easily the worst ""burrito"" I have ever had.
It amazes my that anyone would choose to eat at this chain. I bet the rations they serve from the back of UN trucks to refugees is better."
1,"The service here was awful, we waited patiently for over 15 minutes for our server to come by our table. Finally a hostess came by and noticed nobody was helping us and got us drinks. Another 15 minutes roll by and finally our server decides to make an appearance saying ""have you guys decided yet on what you want?"", uhh yeah!
Overall, service was poor and food was just okay. Won't be going back."
1,"The wash ain't bad....but the process to get it done is pathetic.  The ticket writers at the entrance move in slow motion. They try to upsell at every opportunity.  Four cars backed up waiting to order their service...and the crew is standing around with no cars going thru.
I'd rather drive my car dirty then endure the agony of incompetent management."
1,"I should have taken my own advice and stayed far away from this place. Our most recent visit ended hastily when I was served rotten tuna and got barely a ""sorry"" from the staff. I could smell that the fish had gone horribly, horribly off when the ahi tuna salad was put before me by the waiter, and I'm shocked that the kitchen actually thought they'd get away with sending it out. The waiter disappeared so quickly from my table that I had to go hunt him down to point out the bad smell at my table was coming from the food, and he took my plate back to the kitchen and five minutes later came back to say, ""okay, we all smelled it and there's definitely something wrong there.""

Seriously? You had to go pass it around to confirm that I'm not crazy when you can clearly tell within ten seconds that this is not how raw fish should smell? After all this, their solution was to comp an appetizer, not the salad, and eventually gave me a new salad to go, which I decided not to eat just to be on the safe side. 

Look, I'm not scared to eat week old leftovers or sushi at a divey joint and I don't really get freaked out by the cleanliness of restaurants, but this could have been dangerous.  I have absolutely warned off all my coworkers and friends against this place, and now I'm warning all of Yelp. It could have been handled in a way that left me confident that it was just another new restaurant kink, but the awful service made it clear that's not the case and I shudder to think of what new low they'll sink to."
1,"Really as bad as it gets.
Crap food.
Over priced.
Ugly, tasteless interior
Bad music and music system
Tired staff
This place needs to either have a complete redo or it needs to close. 
I would rather go down the street and eat at Applebee's, and I have never been to an Applebee's. Too many other choices now in the neighborhood for this place to go on in its present condition. Then again, there might be enough people around these parts with really bad taste to keep the place going."
1,"I really wanted to like this place.  For starters, I paid cash for my take out. I was owed back five dollars and was told "" we don't have enough change"". So I had to settle for $2.50. What kind of restaurant doesn't have proper change?  Especially on a Saturday night.  
     The food:  Chicken lettuce wraps had a strange fishy taste. Gave up on them after a few bites.  Vegetable chow mein:  In my opinion, a broun sauce is thick and flavorful. This one was very liquidy and flavorless.  Dumplings were edible at best. 
     Do yourself a favor and stick with China Chili."
1,"I wouldn't write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off. I prefer Papa John's pizza to Dominos or Pizza Hut (by far), but there are some major service issues that have made my five ordering experiences pretty irritating.

They can't find my house. It's not hard to find, I swear. It's a piece of cake, and a stone's throw from a major crossroad. They had once taken two hours to deliver a pizza, saying they tried to call me (they didn't), only to return to the store and bring it back once I called. Naturally, I was delivered a lukewarm pizza, but in the nicest way possible was told that it was *my* mistake.  Unacceptable, in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones, there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line. 

Without complaining, I had received a coupon for a free large pizza. Apology accepted. Upon visiting the store, I got to keep the card *after* ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings. Suckers.

Also, they always take longer than the ETA, even in the middle of a weekday. Even now, I am waiting 70 minutes for a 30-40 minute order, and when I had called 15 minutes ago, was told it was on its way, but that construction was holding it up. Yes, there is construction, but you have taken this long in the past without it. Also, construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza. I even tip nicely.

I enjoy Papa John's pizza, but unless my complaints are addressed, I will never order from this location again. I will encourage my friends to follow suit. RAWR."
1,Went there first thing thing this morning. Ordered 2 simple sandwiches. Took over 35 minutes to make. 6 workers lounging around. Completely ignored. Totally disgusted with their service. Overpriced. Food okay and felt worthless when I left
1,"Tried to get ahold of this dude to no avail. No personal message on his answering machine at all. Website sucks for information to let me know what sorta work or quality thereof he does.
I tried to call here @ 6:53pm tonight and again...no one picks up the phone. So fed up with flaky contractors. Do they want work or not?"
1,"This place has the oiliest food I've ever eaten in my life.  I had carry out one evening (two dishes) and the entrees were soaked in oil.  I had to rinse with water my eggplant dish three times just to eat it without feeling sick to my stomach.  I wish I could've washed the other dish too (but it wasn't one that could be washed--it was a wide-rice noodle dish).

Can definitely taste the MSG in these dishes too.

Really not sure what the fuss is about."
1,"Donuts are really good, if they have any when you get there!!!  Went in on a Tuesday morning at 1030, and they only had a total of 10 donuts. Drove out of my way to go there and still ended up at Dunkin Donuts. Very disappointed!!"
1,"After a day full of meetings, I gathered the hubster and we headed out to eat some Mexican. I had visions of chips/salsa, and margaritas. We headed to On the Border on Stapley near Baseline but found that this location had closed. Egads. Then we remembered The Salty Senorita across the street. And thus begins the saga. ""Hi, are you here for happy hour?"". We said no but were seated in the bar area anyway. At least we got a booth. Lucky us, huh? Joe ""lots of product in his hair"" brought us menus and took our drink orders. He was pushing a certain type of Tequila and I took the bait, with the stipulation ""on the rocks with salt"". My drink, and hubster's water arrived and we ordered. The chips and salsa AND our dinners arrived at the same time. .Really Joe product??? Chips with the meal? FYI, chips and salsa here aren't complimentary, you have to order and pay for them. It was then we noticed ants had taken over our table. At first we thought it was just a couple but noooooooo. The hubster brought the ants to the attention of Joe product and he feigned concern but did not offer to sit us at another table. Now the hubster's getting annoyed. It's hard to enjoy yourself when you are swashing ants off the table. Our booth was by a window but we didn't see any influx from the window of ants, so we're not sure where they are coming from, but they don't stop. Hubster mentions it a second time, and then, again with feigned concern he offers to move us to a different table. By this time we are almost done eating and I just say let's finish and get the hell out of dodge. Our bill comes, we pay, and hubster asks for the manager. Hell, he's even younger than Joe Product and looks like he just woke up, thus we'll call him Bed Head. Bed Head offers to buy us a drink on the house? Really? That's your solution? He said he'd make sure other patrons aren't seated in this area. Egads, no thanks, we just wanted to leave. We weren't after free food, but the offer of 10% off or some kind of compensation for sharing our entire meal with ants would have been appreciated. A free drink? Hey,maybe one of those $60.00 margaritas would have made everything alright! As far as the food goes-I had the chicken antchiladas (get it, lol) with beans and rice and they were dry. I like my enchiladas with oodles of sauce and cheese, and these had very little sauce with a little design of sour cream on them. Hubster had a steak and avocado salad. He said it was ok. 
This is a never return place for us. 
And a note to Joe Product-chips and salsa should have arrived WITH the drinks, and before the meal.Reflecting back, we were there on Earth day so perhaps having ants share our meal was relevant.
The margarita gets a 7 out of 10 limes as it was pretty good."
1,"Maybe their dogs are better, but breakfast sandwiches at Nathan's are disgusting! The English muffin was spongy, the eggs greasy, the bacon undercooked... And all premade and wrapped ready to melt together into mush with the cheese. Yuck!!!"
1,"So, not following my own advice (ahem, NEVER RETURN), I returned here for a friend's birthday dinner a few months ago (I super love this person so how could I say no?). HA! Big mistake. Also, fair warning: there are several-a-CAPS-LOCK ahead.

The only pleasant thing about the evening was the reservation and seating were right on time for our large group (15 people). And of course because we were celebrating a super special person.

I'll keep this update short and sweet:

$3 for a CAN OF SODA? Get real. I knew it'd be overpriced but I was at least expecting a mini bottle or something. But a can? COME ON. You bought that in bulk and paid .03342 cents for it. FAIL.

Your servers: IDIOTS. First it takes our server 15 minutes to come around the first time and take drink orders. Then she's back another 15 minutes after that taking the orders again. Did you forget? Were you not paying attention the first time we around? Why did it take 30 minutes just to order drinks? And on top of that we wait another 15 to receive them. FORTY-FIVE MINUTES TO RECEIVE DRINKS IS BAD. Very, very bad. 

Also, not taking food orders until after we've been seated for ONE HOUR is BAD. VERY, VERY BAD. Seated at 8 o'clock, we didn't receive our food until almost TEN O'CLOCK. TWO HOURS FOR FOOD IS VERY, VERY BAD. Do you hear that, St. Francis? BAD.

Because I loathed the place even before this lovely birthday dinner, and because the thought of supporting such an establishment makes my blood boil, I ordered only dessert and the hubs ordered an appetizer (and add on a $3 can soda). Funny, that our bill was still nearly $30 for the both of us. Excluding tip. BAD.

Also, server: If you say you're not going to split a check, stick to your word or don't even try. Now, I'M glad you didn't stick to your stingy ""I don't split checks"", because I could foresee the mess of trying to split a $700 bill with 13 people I didn't know so well. Lucky for us, when we told you we were leaving early and asked for our check, you split it for us. A couple others caught on and did the same, but the remaining 7-8 people were not so lucky. 

Because I realize my short and sweet is not so short anymore (or sweet, for that matter), I'm ending it here. NOTE TO SELF: heed own advice and stay away from St. Francis!"
1,"Take your money elsewhere, unless you've got kids.  I really try to like this place.  A family member signed me up for the discount card, so I've been going more often, but I just don't love it.  It's simply ok, but the prices are outrageous.  And the sounds and animatronics are a huge distraction from the so-so food.  The cocktails are alright, but, again, the price is not right.  The ony thing fun about the place for an adult is the gift shop and the light-up cocktail glasses (which cost extra.)  I've seen a lot of happy families in here though, so I bet it's better if you have little ones to bring along."
1,"Disclaimer: I am a Thai person and a Thai food connoisseur. 

This is supremely average Thai food and overpriced as heck to take advantage of White People. Sorry to be blunt but that's all it is. $18 dishes that are $8 at a real Thai restaurant. The spring rolls were very bland and came with only a tiny bit of sauce for dipping. They should also include on the table a selection of fish sauces and spices to add to your meals and appetizers. They dont have.

If you like spicy, skip it for sure. Again this is what we would call Tourist Thai back in Thailand. 

Tiny servings.

The good. Friendly wait staff.

If authentic Thai is what you're looking for try any of these: Palees Crown, Tum Nak Thai or Royal Thai Grill."
1,"Bad shop, rude owners. Pro-tip: If you want to ""enhance"" the Phoenix community you could start by not playing music loudly when it's obvious that there are musicians trying to perform their sets that people paid to see at the well-respected venue next door."
1,"We used to go to this UPS store quite frequently and had been satisfied with their service, but it has been at least a year since we regularly patronized the place.  However, we had a really unprofessional experience here recently.  We went there for rotary services for purchase of home which one employee refused to do and handed off to another employee (because as she under her breath, notary services were a pain).  This employee could not help us either as ""he had never seen anything like it, and he didn't know  want to  have anything to do with something that had power of attorney on it.""  I guess we are one of the first people around here to sell a home. While we waited for this man to do something, the employee who handed off our paperwork, tried and failed to scan a document to email and was quite verbal and (sorry) hickish about these ""stupid"" machines.  After looking at all was going on, we didn't want anyone here handling our notary services.  Eek - felt like we dodged a bullet.  Also, don't think I will be going there for any other services.  I felt like my IQ dropped 20 points when I went in there."
1,I will never go here again. So disappointed when I went in its a cute store don't get me wrong I would buy so much there for my dog. But the day I went I went to get a treat for my dog for his birthday. The lady was on her phone the whole time talking personal business while my mother and I stood they're waiting for her to get off or put the person on hold. All we wanted to do was to ask her to get that dog cookie for us. So after 10 minutes of waiting we decided to leave and while walking out the door the lady shouted thanks for coming. That pissed me off cause she put down the phone to say bye but not to get an actual freaking sale. I'll continue going to to petsmart. Tried to support a local business but I guess when you own your own place you can have poor customer service
1,"Wow! I can't believe this place gets so many good reviews. 
I was hauled here once by co-workers looking for a cheap meal. But, how much value does your lunch dollar have when you don't even want to eat the food? Dry and sticky rice; ""white meat chicken"" unidientifiable as such, and a sweet glaze that provided the only flavor. Quite frankly, it was disgusting, and none of the dishes my co-workers had looked any better (though they seemed to be fine with them). I should know to stay away from restaurants that have pictures of their menu items on the wall. The one star is only for the fast and friendly service."
1,"This place has NO clue when it comes to pricing men's items, and I would not recommend them at all.  I consigned a leather briefcase worth close to $600, and they priced it for $90, giving me a whopping take-home of $40.  I understand the need to move merchandise quickly (and naturally, this sold in a matter of days), but cannot fathom why they would not attempt to get more money for the item.  I can only assume they did not do their research before setting the price.  Consigner beware!"
1,"RUDE RUDE RUDE
I wanted to book a diner for my wife and I ( our anniversary.
. The website i was on did not post the times of operation.  I left a message and today got a call back from a RUDE Owner.  He argues it is right there. He did not ask anything about where i was o tried to help . He called to argue  with me. 
 I can not believe i get a call at work and then when i tell the reason of the issue he argues with me and hangs up... childish behavior . I read the reviews on DEX and other sites and found that this is true across the board. Poor food prep and pretentious environment and owners... good bye Lon's  chief - ill never go to your location now.  And my 12,000 Sedona list will  be aware of your bad manners.  I am a native to Scottsdale and Lon's was a place that we went to almost 6 times a year. It was my mother's favorite place to eat. - until the food started going down hill. I believe it was these people who were at the helm at that time. I heard they were asked to leave.

Hanging up on people.... this is incredible...   DO NOT GO HERE!!"
1,After moving back to the area from Cali I needed somewhere  to get my acrylics done. I usually like to get some kind of design or unique tips. After walking in I saw some tips I liked so I decided to try out this place. The first visit was bad the nail tech would not listen to the length of nails I was requesting and did a terrible job at shaping them. I always give people more than one chance so I went back and this time I got a pedicure first then the nail tech left the salon and I sat near the dryer for 45  min before approaching the manager about the length of time I had been waiting for a fill. He replied unapologetically that the tech had to leave to pick up her son from school... I sat another 15 min before I was seen by someone else. They also did a poor job. I will not spend my money somewhere that they do not value their customers. Not to mention they did a crap job and were overpriced when it came to designs and tips with prints on them. Don't waste your time here.
1,"I went here while on vacation visiting my friend. Neither of us had been there before, but I know they have lots of locations on the west coast, so we gave it a try. 

The staff was totally rude. Before we went, we called to check the hours. The guy on the phone was patronizing and acted inconvenienced to have to give any information. 

The pizza was blah - totally generic and nothing special. If you're going to have mediocre food, you better have exceptional service. Double fail."
1,"Went last night to Whore Foods to get basics to make pizza with, most clutch to the process was a three pack of yeast. Low and behold, the dirty hippie kids they have working there again didn't put something in the bag.

And this time it was the yeast.

I love the food there, but the employees are nothing more than entitled hippie kids from Scottsdale who can't be bothered to do their goddamn jobs! I am so sick of this crap with this corporation. Maybe its a Phoenix thing, or maybe its the hiring and firing processes of Whore Foods, but I am done shopping at any Whore Foods. In a place like Phoenix, where you have alternatives such as Sprouts, you'd think Whore Foods would smarten up.

Or when you try to ask someone who works here where something is, and they just walk by with their nose high in the air. I understand its important to show your fellow dirt merchants that you're a super star, but I don't work with you, I contribute to your salary and over inflated set of benefits for a grocery clerk, so do your goddamn job. Useless little girl in need of a shower and orthodontist. 

But alas, Whore Foods and its dirty hippie employees have alienated yet another person with a job and a degree into hating everything that place stands for.

Oh yea, one other thing, take the concealed firearm prohibition off of your stores. It didn't stop Jared Loughner from doing something horrid, and all it does is alienate law abiding citizens from their Constitutional rights. I understand you think that only parts of the Constitution should apply, but honestly I think you need to pull your collective heads out of your ass and take a shower.

Useless motherf*&#$@s!"
1,"Had some time to kill before the Ultimate pleY Date Yelp event, and I'd wanted to share my love of Nobuo's Dark chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream and sugared orange peels with my happy-go-lucky cousin, who has never been here before, so we stopped by at 5:17p to find that Nobuo wouldn't open till 5:30p, so we waited outside in the comfortable patio.

After watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables, I noticed the ""OPEN"" sign on the front door, so we entered the resto, whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a two-top.  I didn't like the energy in that room, so I asked if we could sit elsewhere, and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit.  We were the first customers, so we chose a four-top, knowing we wouldn't be taking up space for very long, anyway.  Glasses of water were delivered, and soon we met our female server (whose name on the receipt reflected ""Butai"").  When she laid down the menus, I told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu?  I wished we had a video of the look she gave us, a look of pure distaste, as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said ""We don't have dessert menus, as we only have two..."" and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almond-orange fritters.  She walked away, and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there, she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have.  I decided to forgo our server's very cold treatment and asked for the mousse.  After all, I'd already finished a glass of ice-cold water and cousin's phone needed recharging...  

When Butai placed our chocolate mousse http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg#rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg on the table, I wanted to send it back.  Where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert I had here?  Was she serious in presenting us with this stale-looking mousse, with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it?  I don't know about you, but the only times I've seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to re-freeze.  For me, seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old...  I brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host, who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 4:00a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal, so I decided we would go ahead and try it, if for nothing else but to have something to report here.  The dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ I had during our October OYE in taste and presentation, but it was OK.  The mousse was still cold and stiff, and it had a mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing on a cake- certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence I knew it could be.  My cousin had to warm up to the dish, as the sound of chocolate and green tea together didn't seem like a great combo to her (I told her to trust me).  She also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together, but she liked it in this dessert.  

I understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner AND dessert, which translates to a higher table bill, can be a bit of a disappointment, but why must you show your displeasure to your guests?  Butai, you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip- she didn't want to give you anything, and you certainly didn't deserve it!  When I told other Yelp friends about the sub-par service and dessert we just had, one replied she didn't enjoy the last time we had apps here (I think it was around Halloween and First Friday?) either.  Cousin and I thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful, condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert; We didn't deserve that!  I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore.  I even promised my Japanese friend (who lives and works overseas) I'd treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit.  Guess I'll have to find another place to take her...  I don't want to risk getting the same treatment from Butai, or from another server should we come back here.  

Sorry, Nobuo, but I won't be returning."
1,"Have the owners from here ever even had a bagel from back east? Certainly doesn't taste like it, and they charge double what they do back east too. No thanks. The search for a good bagel continues, for now I'll just keep having them shipped straight from NJ."
1,"I enjoy falafels and my boyfriend really likes Gyros.  So, when we received a coupon for Daphne's Greek Café we were jazzed to go check it out.

What I noticed right away is it has kind of a fast-food sort of feel to it and I thought, OK, its catering to people on their lunch breaks.  However, the food itself is like Greek fast food for people who have never had anywhere near really Greek food before and so they wouldn't know any better.

The plates are astatically pleasing with everything arranged nice and neat.  This amounted to zilch to me.  When I got to eat, I want plenty of food and I want quality as appropriately expected from the type of establishment I am eating at.  

At Daphne's you get a few little thin slices of what may or may not be real gyro meat.  The falafel meat is little over fried disks.  That's right disks.  Not balls of falafel meat where the outside is slightly crunchy and the inside is meaty and moist.  The pita bread is not.  It's just some flat bread cut into little triangles.  The tzatziki sauce is ... what the heck is this stuff in this little 1 inch paper cup?  The vegetables were fresh.

There is more to complain about with this place, but you get the picture.  I'm thinking that anyone who likes it here just doesn't know what real Greek food is like."
1,"If only I where rating this place based on their sushi I would give it 5 stars.  But, I'm not  rating it based on the food.  It is purely based on the customer service in this establishment.  Be warned; if you have a large party this is NOT the place to go.  I've been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years and I have NEVER heard of a restaurant not splitting checks for large parties.  So for an over 500.00 bill they will take 15+ different forms of payment but won't split up the check by individuals or couples.  How does this make any sense.  To make matters worse; they bring out the sushi and I quote ""family style"".  Since when did sushi get served family style?  Here is the problem.  Sushi is expensive, not everyone at the table ate it and when served ""family style"" someone else may get what you ordered and you won't have a clue it even made it to the table.  We spent over 40 minutes trying to figure out this bill, SERIOUSLY!  When I asked the manager her generic and obviously well rehearsed response was ""this is our company policy, we do not split checks for large parties"".  This is absurd.  So not only did we have a heck of a time figuring out the bill, I'm pretty sure no one really knew who had what and if they had added random things to the bill.  How could you know with that many people ordering????  I never received part of what I ordered yet it made it on that bill.  So here we have to pay it regardless of what we may or may not have received?  I understand that adding gratuity to a party this size is also common practice which I don't normally have a problem with but how about some EXCELLENT customer service in return.  If policy is no separate checks, at least tell everyone as they order or as a group that this will occur.  They said someone was told when the reservation was made.  The reservation was made for 25 people!  It would've taken 2 seconds to again relay this important piece of information.  Worst experience ever!"
1,Not a company to do business with ... From my experience !'
1,"Absolutely gross-  I'm just going to be bluntly honest- who the F cares what the food tastes like when the place looks like a frickin' dump?  It was so disgustingly dirty inside. Besides food, paper, trash- resting among the carpet- the tables were dirty, the bathroom was out of service and I feared touching anything as I was led to my seat... that's a problem.

I've actually never seen such a messy restaurant before. Let me also say that the restaurant was empty when we arrived, and was filthy when we walked in and was filthy when we left. 

Obviously no one that works at this restaurant cares about cleaning up between seatings. There's no excuse for a place to be disgusting like this. It's downright unsanitary. You serve food Valle Luna, you're a business Valle Luna- keep the place clean for heaven's sake."
1,"My wife and I were looking for a particular type of rose for our garden. We called this location and asked if they had it in stock and what the price was. They said they did and quoted us a price of $24.99 for a gallon sized plant. Good to go. We drive there and find the rose bush but it is listed as $44.99. So we go to the front and say that  we had called and driven 30 minutes to get this rose and we were told ""Oops...sometimes the  prices on my list up front right"". No sh!t Sherlock. So...will you honor the price quoted? NO. 

So we drove down the street to A And P Nursery on Baseline west of Lindsay and got the same size plant that they were selling for $44.99 for $16.99. 

Don't waste your time with these rip-off artists."
1,"Until they get their quality under control, we won't eat here except for lunch. We ate here last weekend and both had the roasted chicken. The problem was it tasted like it was basted in cinnamon and the sauce for the risotto had at least 10 whole peppercorns on each of our plates. I actually bit into to one before I realized that the sauce was just crawling with them. They could've strained them out, processed them in, whatever, just don't serve me a plate with a bunch of whole peppercorns. This tasted NOTHING like the previous visit when I ordered the same exact dish. When we finally let the management know that our food was unacceptable, he said the best he could do was a 20% discount. Well. we  weren't looking for a free or discounted meal, but rather some acknowledgement that they actually cared about the food. That never happened. Unless something changes, the burgers are decent and that is about it."
1,"when i worked in retail my paycheck was spent before i got paid. therefore, i relied heavily on coupons and splitting meals w all of my other poor college friends.

well, i hit the jackpot. $15 coupon for a FEAST. the picture on the coupon showed everything we would get: a huge steak, shrimp, and lobster PLUS 2 sides. there were 3 of us- this was PLENTY. 

it was prom night too so we were initally fooled with how popular it was. popular for prom girls with light up clear shoes (not even lying), if that says anything about the crowd for you...

our waitress stops by our booth and just stares at us. one of my friend kinda looks around at me and our other friend, then back at the waitress. 'ill have a diet coke?'

then our waitress writes it down and doesn't say anything but looks at my other friend.

i lost it and started laughing. why isn't she talking to us? this is so weird. 

we ended up asking for a different waitress, then found out the coupon was a big fat liar. you didn't get all of that. it just says you do but you don't. the food ended up being nasty. probably one of the worst meals ive ever had. 

as we're leaving susy talks a lot waitress trips over my friend and it was all too awkward bc i couldn't control laughing. 

awful food, awful service, AND the bathrooms were some of the grossest i had ever been in. 

if wal-mart ran a restaurant, this would be it."
1,"IHOP is barely a step up from Denny's in terms of boring chain food. Last night was the first time I ever had dinner there, and it tasted like squishy, mushy cardboard. The food took forever even though there were only three tables in the place with customers.

The reason I gave it two stars instead of you is because the breakfasts are pretty good. I don't mind them except the omlettes which are way too oily. The coffee is almost bad, but the waitresses always look happy.

[update April 2, 2011]

Why'd I go back? I hate this place now. We went today for the first time we have all had a chance to go out together for breakfast. I was excited to do this and was eager. I should've stayed home.

My wife got a waffle with her combo that was cold, tasted like cardboard, and was crunchy. The bacon my wife and child ordered was burnt, crispy and did not look like bacon at all.

My sausage (I always upgrade to turkey sausage since the regular pork kid here is vomit worth) was totally cold. I sent it back and complained. I think she microwaved my plate. 

Their coffee is always burnt so I got an iced coffee. She said they had Mocha, Vanilla, or Hazelnut. I asked if they just had a regular coffee flavored one... she said yes, and brought me disgusting hazelnut (glad I'm not allergic!!)

Ok now it's three hours later. My daughter laid on the floor whining about how bad her stomach hurts, I've been to the bathroom twice and my wife is asleep because she said if she didn't lay down, she would puke. Seriously.

The management (district managers) really need to care enough to read YELP.  They remodeled the outside of this place and, I guess, spent all their money to make it look pretty so we'd forget they serve dogfood."
1,"Rude, rude, rude. I will *never* go back to this place. I don't normally carry cash and when I went to pick up my son's pants for his recital that night, I was in a little bit of a jam (they only take cash or checks). When I suggested they might put this on the claim ticket, or at least mention it when people drop off their clothes, the owner pointed to an itty bitty sign and told me ""we have signs everywhere."" The owner was hostile and argumentative and just didn't care about what I had to say. Then he hovered over me while my son tried his pants on, like I was going to steal something (the place is TINY). I went to an ATM and pulled out cash, it wasn't that big of a deal, but this place has no customer service skills whatsoever. I won't ever go there again. Steer clear."
1,"This place is a freaking joke. Expect an overcrowded waiting room and at minimum an hour wait. They see children but there is nothing in the waiting room to entertain them so they are all screaming and crying. There's not even room for a stroller. Horrible, horrible experience!"
1,"NOTE: This review concerns the Roberto's on Union Hills and 7th Ave. NOT the Roberto's in Anthem!


I am only giving it one star because I can't give it 0. Simply put i was very sick after dining there recently. This was the only meal I did not share with my family and therefor the only culprit to my food borne illness. I have enjoyed this place in the past but recently the quality has gone downhill. Now they are closed on Sunday's.

I wish i had read recent reviews on here before i had gone. they have slipped VERY far since there Diners Drive-ins and Dives days. 

the guy that both took my order and cooked my food was obviously drunk. sitting on his cellphone playing what appeared to be a video game when i walked in."
1,"Brought a group to Metro for brunch, made the reservation a month ago, called three days ago to update and ask to be outside and people arrived and were told there was no reservation. Finally spoke with the manager and had that sorted out but when I asked for our tables outside and they couldn't accommodate. 

Having the bartender wait on a party of 18 was idiotic. Not enough menus, slow, horrible drinks, no silverware, soup was burnt-how do you burn soup??? Attempting to fix the situation with beignets was a nice attempt until we heard the server swearing about having to deal with us. 

I host events all over the valley and never have I experienced service as horrible as I did at Metro. 

They have recently changed management, unfortunately the great reviews I read when I made the reservation don't hold true anymore.

Update 11/8/2010
Since my first review I received a $50 gift certificate from the management of Metro.  I decided to go for dessert last Friday night with 5 of my friends.  I knew I couldn't just go with one other person, it had to be a group to show what they could do.  

We arrived at 9:15 and were seated on the patio.  I met the general manager and she was pleasant enough, I never saw her again.  There was no one seated inside and the patio was half full.

Jesse greeted us and was the most attentive and understanding server when two guests needed to return their drinks to the bar because they were not made properly - it was a specialty drink from their cocktail menu.

We ordered beignets, apple bread pudding and triple chocolate delight.  The beignets and apple bread pudding were good.  The triple chocolate delight had absolutely no chocolate flavor at all.

Jesse was by far an excellent server and if you go ask to be seated in his section."
1,"I suppose you could just put me in the ""box"" with ""Luis T"" on 3.20.10...because if i didnt know any better, his could have been my entry.. So i was here this week.  Let me start by saying i have been giving Los Dos Molinos my  business for almost 20 years now, and each year that goes by i find myself saying that i am going to cease my patronage.  I will save the stories from the recent years and why i've been feeling this way, and give you just the specifics from my most recent visit:  If you want to make the rule that there are ""No Split Checks"" then can you AT THE VERY LEAST get with the current times and make the bill somewhat decipherable?  We had a large party, and were quite promptly advised there were no split checks, yet at the end of the night we were left with a ribbon of calculator tape with ONLY prices, and no correlation with actual menu items...so we had to cross reference the menu to figure out what the heck all the itemizations correlated to.   And by the end of it, we pretty much gave up and just guessed at what each person should contribute because the receipt may have just as well been in morse code.  Ok, im getting ahead of myself..Its one thing if you have subpar service and the restaurant is slammed, understaffed, there is a MLB baseball game or NBA basketball game, or concert going on...This was not the case.  We were the ONLY table inside the restaurant and the service absolutely sucked.  How many times must one flag down the server for (take your pick) A;  refill on chips B: refill on ice water and C:(most importantly since the drinks are marked up 300%) a FRESH DRINK!!! Oh yes and D: Check please.  We had to look over our shoulders for A , B, C, and D.  When our table collectively decided the service was ridiculous we decided the tip would reflect that, and then we realized an 18% gratuity was included...well no wonder.  When that is the case, there is NO incentive for decent service!! We brought several items to the attention of the bald headed caucasian man who may have been a manager of some sort but his severe lack of customer service skills merely resulted in him stating in a childish voice ""They are complaining about the service"" to an audience that didnt exist.  Damn right! and damn right we will take our business elsewhere.  Grandma Chavez is rolling in her grave! you should be ashamed!"
1,"Other than the really great happy hour prices, its hit or miss with this place. More often a miss. :(

The food is less than average, the drinks NOT strong ( at least they are inexpensive) , but the service is truly hit or miss.

I'll pass."
1,This place is over priced and the service is horrible. I went there with my feiends and the server was very rude and degrading!
1,"OMG! I am so frustrated at this store, I have never met such an incompetent group of people in my entire shopping life. 

First, I called Fry's Electronics to check to see if they had a specific GPS model that worked in Europe. I called because I live at 115th Ave and Buckeye which is about 20miles from the nearest store. The call center informed me they did not carry that model but listed about 10 other GPS with maps of Europe. I asked again those models have maps of Europe? ""Yes and Australia too"". And you have those models in stock? ""Yes."" What is the price range? ""$100 to $300"". Thank you. FIRST MISINFORMATION! 

So I drove to  30th Ave and Thunderbird, talked with ""GPS Specialist"" (which apparently means nothing) and he (Jared) informed me they did not have any GPS units with European maps!! He said the call center ""is a bunch of retards"" and that those were all last years models. 

Then he called someone and looked at several GPS Units. When he did not know  if the unit had European maps or not he GOOGLED them! (okay not confident in your product knowledge). Then he sold me a $260 unit with European maps. SECOND MISINFORMATION. 

I drove all the way home and the GPS did not have European maps! I had to buy them for another $100 which I could have done with a cheaper GPS.

So I drive back to Fry's. Speak with a Supervisor, they return my first GPS. I speak with the same sales rep (ya thats great). He says he figured out 25min after I left that he sold me the wrong product and none of their GPS have european maps. 

So I then buy the cheapest model that was could download European maps, according the the sales rep Garmin NUVI 50Lm for $129.  THIRD MISINFORMATION. Because according to the Garmin site the NUVI 40Lm is also compatible and cheaper. 

I then went home bought the $100 European map and couldn't download it to my GPS because there wasn't enough space available!!!

Now I have to buy a miniSD Card and a miniSD reader for my Mac book. Awesome. Great to know that the electronic store knows nothing about electronics!"
1,"Treated with complete disrespect. Worst service I have ever experienced.  After waiting to see the manager I was directed to an employee who committed slander towards me very loudly in front of everyone in the store. Then the manager stepped in, spoke robotically without listening and then was incredibly harsh in tone and told me to leave. He said, ""leave, get out, now"" 
****************Don't go to this store/don't use verizon******************"
1,"My rating is based on the fact that as a vegetarian, they charge $8 for a small mediocre bean burrito.  Maybe if this bean burrito were exceptionally good or large in size, but it was neither.  I'm not saying that if your idea of Mexican food is Chipolte, you will not find what you are looking for and be happy here. But if what you offer your vegetarian customers is deleting the meat and not adding anything else and charging full price, I can get MUCH BETTER elsewhere and pay way less.  

GRINGOS:  Take off the Chipolte blindfolds!  Go to a real Mexican restaurant and see what real food is supposed to taste like!"
1,"Wow... After eating sushi from across the nation i have to say Scottsdale's Geisha A Go Go has surprised me for an ultimate low. Andrew, the manager, reassured us that we had something wrong with our taste buds for not tasting how fresh the fish was here. Insulting to assume. Not recommended!!!!"
1,"Treachery! Seek it out:

Let me begin this review by saying that mine is not an indictment on this particular location but on every single P.F. Chang's I've had the misfortune of being dragged to.

P.F. Chang's is effectively the Cheesecake Factory of bad Chinese food, with the disadvantage of not being as capable of delivering passable food. They bill themselves as a ""gourmet"" Asian experience, which is a bit of a laugh when they turn around and sell you their equally horrible frozen entrées right from the convenience of your local Wal-Mart. Everything is bland, overcooked, and ridiculously priced. 

Once you've paid nearly $14 for their ""orange peel chicken"", you may privately hope to yourself that they might have the audacity to include some fried rice. This is your second mistake. Sadly, the bistro calls you on your bullshit. You get white or brown--fried rice is several dollars extra and not at all worth it.

Everything seems to be cooked just wrong--things that shouldn't be are too crispy, things that should be sauced are too dry, things that should taste good make you question the will of the gods, all the while you find there's no way to escape the treachery.

Things get more and more frustrating as you dig deeper: P.F. Changs, while sounding vaguely Asian, is a wholly American creation. It was founded by Paul Fleming (in Scottsdale, actually) with SOMEone with some Asian influence to spice it up a bit, named Philip Chiang. (They literally cut out the poor bastard's ""i"" so that it would ""fit on the signs better,"" or, as I like to believe, not scare away the flyover-states-white-folk so.) It's highly Americanized (and yes, I've had Chinese food in China, but I've also enjoyed great ""American Chinese"" food here) to the point of regrettable blandness and it is SO VERY EXPENSIVE you may find your credit score taking a ding after eating a plate of ""wok charred beef"", listed as one of the saltiest foods in America.

The decoration is clumsy and their famous inclusion of terra cotta warriors are literally symbols of death. From Jennifer 8 Lee's Fortune Cookie Chronicles:

'But not everyone finds the terra-cotta warriors charming. ""Chinese people would never put that in a restuarant,"" Jim told me, pointing at the statues. ""It's not lucky. It's something you put at a burial site! But in America, they think it's a Chinese thing."" From a Chinese perspective, P.F. Changs is decorated with death.'

Which is just fine, because everything there tastes like death anyway."
1,"I've been boycotting this store since 2009.  One afternoon after browsing for a while with my kids, I allowed my 10yo and 8yo to stay in the children's section to pick out a book to spend their allowance money on while I ran next door to TJ Maxx to buy the toddler a pair of shoes.  I'd been gone 30 minutes when I returned to find the horrid lady in the children's section had called the police on us.  She never asked the kids  their ages and didn't ask if they had a way to reach me (they did).  The police talked to them, realized they were perfectly well behaved consumers, and assured me I'd done nothing illegal.  Avoid like the plague."
1,"Ugh!!  

A 25 min wait greeted us before anyone recognized our presence.  We were offered complientary champaigne in consideration.  Who drinks champainge??

We were allowed to order wine prior to hearing of the chef's feast, which offers a wine pairing.  That's dumb.

We ordered a meat/cheese plate.  It contained head cheese.  Hmmmm.  Overpriced and oversalted.

30 min later our salads came.  The salads were ok and unfortunately the highlight of the meal.

35 min later our main course came.  Overcooked, uneventful, lame.

I can't drink alcohol and ordered water.  Twice I was left w/ no water for extended periods.  Both times I was foced to ask for water.

There were no hand towels in the unisex bathroom.  It's no fun to dry your hands using toilet paper.

The ""best"" part was saved for last.  Quiessence automatically adds an 18% gratuity, which is OK assuming the service is at least adequate.  It wasn't.  Further, as our waiter dropped the bill, he explained the 18% ""goes to the house"" and anything additional we might addd, though not required, is most appreciated.  Egad....why does the house need a service charge w/ the magnificent margins they charge for their normal food service?  And why do they put their staff in the position of shaking down their patrons for tips?

Although it's a very nice, calming setting, I found myself wanting to leave after the first appy.  Food, service and ancillary were simply terrible.  Stay away.  You'll spend your $175 for 2 much better most anywhere else."
1,"I will precede this lackluster review by stating the following:

1)I have only been to this place once.
2)I didn't get a chance to actually try the cuisine.
3)I am a sympathetic person to servers, as I have been one.

That being said, I give this place one star for reasons of poor service.

About six months ago, at around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon, we decided to eat at this place. The atmosphere was warm and cozy; typical college bar with college-aged waitresses.

We made sandwich selections and ordered happy hour beers. The beers came, the food never did, and we watched other patrons come in, eat, and leave.  All the while, our waitress never came by to give us an explanation or even get us another round of drinks (we got them ourselves from the bar). 

Since my bf and I both worked in food service, we are always sympathetic when we can see that a place is under-staffed.  But after an hour of waiting, we finally crossed the room to speak with our server. She said, ""I can't imagine it will be much longer."" I think the more professional approach would have been an apology and admitting to forgetting to put in our ticket, which is what we gathered when we saw her speaking frantically with the cook.

Where was the manager that day? Or someone who noticed that we sat there so long without our food or any communication at all?

We left money on the table for our beers and walked out. I guess there is a first time for everything."
1,"Hot Breakfast..........NOT, Again cold food when it supposed to be hot....people beware of this over price place and lack of care for the customer it seems that this is the way of doing business.

*** Again a nice place to visit but DO NOT EAT HERE.*** And DO NOT CARE!"
1,"4 stars for the place itself and it's food/coffee.
0 stars for the service, or lack there of.  My business partner and I were in town for a convention.  We heard we should check out Lola.  So we did.  We were excited.  The lady (I use the term loosely here) who took our order was LESS than patient OR helpful.  We asked a few questions.  She barely answered us, then when we had to repeat the question she was nothing short of annoyed.  An example.  We asked where we could get a glass or cup of water.  She mumbled something about the bar/table.  My partner walked over and saw no cups.  She came back and asked where the cups were.  On the table came an exasperated retort.  I walked over to inspect for myself.  There were no cups on the table.  So I kindly asked her if the cups should be on the table, if so there appeared to be none.  She said they are on the table, but *sigh* I'll go check, but I know they're there!  10 seconds later she comes out of the kitchen with a tube of cups.  IMAGINE THAT the customer was right.  I watched this lady serve other customers.  It appears that regulars are treated with a smile and courtesy and patience.  Newcomers or people she doesn't like are treated worse than the dirt on the bottom of her shoes.

My suggestion to management, adjust her attitude or get rid of her!  She is not good for business."
1,"No offense to everyone who gave this place 5 stars, but the Tempe Cinema staff needs a swift kick in the ass. During school hours, this place is regularly crawling with hooligan truants. Maybe those who run this theatre want to ensure they will have a steady stream of staffing options from the dropouts who use it as a hideout. Losers."
1,"What.  The.   Heck. ??    Be prepared for sticker shock!  I walked in, through the store, and made a hasty straight line back to exit.  And over and across the road to Crate & Barrel  - Ahhhhhh - much better!  Whew!"
1,"I can summarize this in one word.  YUCK!  We went for dinner/supper, which is part of the problem.  We ordered t-bone steak and chicken.  The salad bowl had a hole right through the plastic and the steak was way thin.  We ordered it medium and any steak that thin just ends up being cooked as ""well done"" anyway.  Everything comes with grease dripping hash browns whether you want them or not.  At least the staff was friendly enough and food (if you call it that) was served quickly.  My personal recommendation is that if you're not going to eat breakfast, go somewhere else."
1,"The service at this location is absolutely atrocious. I went to the Starbucks to get a Frappuccino, as I've done many times at this location without issue. The employee working the counter had an absolutely revolting tattoo near her collar bone and a scowl on her face. She asked me if I had a membership AFTER I had swiped my card, then said ""Too late,"" when I told her I had one.

Then, the idiot with the spiky blonde hair made me a Frappuccino that was basically brown water. I told her to make it again. She made it again, then informed me that she put extra shots of chocolate in it, and I should ask for extra chocolate if I don't want it to taste like water. I have never had a problem with the way my drink tasted until that day, but apparently the problem lies with me.

I'm not the one who chose a career in customer service. If the coffee slingers at this branch can't pretend to enjoy their jobs, they should be put out on the street."
1,"Every time I've been there they have messed up my order in some way. The first time I ordered a sonic blast w Carmel. They charged me for Carmel but there was none in it plus the bottom of the cup was busted and my ice cream was leaking out. The next I went I ordered a reese sonic blast and a snickers, they were both snickers. Very upset I haven't been back and I love that place."
1,"My husband and I have Been meaning to go in here and see if it was anything like hong kong gourmet, so yesterday for lunch we decided to give it a try. Huge mistake! The food was literally inedible, everything was either too cold or burnt to a char, nothing tasted good. We decided to try the desert and the cream puff (I'm unsure how you can mess that up) was petrified and the cream was so gross I spit it out. The smell of the flan actually made us gag, we had such an awful time I complained to the manager. She didn't even seem to care, and gave us 20% off of a lunch we didn't even eat. We were disgusted by this place, and we will never, ever go back. Don't do it, you will regret it!"
1,If you like the stuck up Scottsdale vibe this is a good place for you. The food isn't impressive. Nice outdoor seating.
1,"I signed up for Yelp just because of the poor service and being cheated out of money from Cafe Rio. I already voiced my complaint to the restaurant and to their website in writing, however I haven't received a phone call or email back.

I've visited this establishment twice and each time I go I receive very little toppings on my burrito or tacos. I understand that it's made to your order like Chiptole or Qdoba, but they'll add very little cheese or toppings on your food, which can cause you to request more. To save myself time and every yelpers eyes from reading this long story, the individual making my tacos was extremely frugal on the toppings on my tacos. She barely put any cheese on my 3 tacos and I simply requested that she could put a little more on the tacos. She did and when I went to pay for my order, I was charged an extra 95 cents for ""side cheese."" The issue isn't the money because eating at Cafe Rio can be expensive for a fast-food mexican restauant, but it's the principle of charging me extra after I said, ""can you please put a little more cheese on my taco."" 

This hasn't been the first time this happened, but a previous visit had the same result with the sauce on my burrito. I thought mexican food restaurants had gigantic burritos and generous size tacos, but Cafe Rio will charge you on top of your order if you don't like their skinny tacos.

All I ask for from Cafe Rio to acknowledge that when you add more toppings to what the cook's add to your food, that they say, ""this will be extra."" They do this at Chiptole and Qdoba, but Cafe Rio would rather screw you over at the end. 

I will not be visiting this establishment again. As I said, it's the principle as to why they charged me extra for this, not the money."
1,"One hour. That is how long we waited after ordering before we decided we would rather eat anywhere that wasn't here. A crushing, impressively underwhelming experience in lack of service.

We arrived, found we had free valet parking? With a teensy parking lot, this works, thank you. A good selection of indoor and outdoor seating? Also a plus. Setting expectations and/or taking care of waiting customers? FAIL.

On a beautiful AZ autumn morning we came here (tho we entered Rockerij). We asked to be re-seated outside because inside of Rockerij is dark as a tomb and had loud, conversation intruding, music. We were reseated by the fireplace, and a waiter came over shortly to take our order. Bam. So far so good...or so we thought. 30 Mins after placing our order, I ask another waiter to check on the status of our food and he cleverly asks about what we ordered (exactly)...so we think it is being taken care of. 40 MINS after placing our order, I have still only had my coffee refilled once...and had to flag down another waiter to inquire about the status of our food again, because our actual waiter is nowhere to be found and the previous ""drive-by"" waiter never returned. A few mins beyond that, this guy actually comes back and indicates that our order is nearly ready and should only be a few minutes longer. Shortly thereafter OUR waiter stops by with comments of: 

""I don't know why it's taking so long...""
and
""I put the ticket in right after I took your order...""

So...as a waiter...maybe it might be part of your job to check on the status of an order say...15mins after bringing it by the kitchen? Perchance? What do you think?

FIFTEEN (15 == few?) minutes later, we still had no food and I'd had quite enough. Out the door we went.

On a comical note: As we were outside (another 5 minute wait because the valet had our car either parked in Egypt somewhere or tandem?) our waiter came out to find us to let us know that our food was ready if we'd like to come back inside?

Oh R E A L L Y? The Clue-Delivery Train will be visiting you shortly. Facial cues you may want to look for in the future are:
1) the furrowed eyebrows
2) fuck-you facial expression
and
3) curling fists

It seems that we are not alone in this. Courtney W.'s review (10/14/12) is representative of what we experienced.

I am dumbfounded how they have any good reviews. There must be a serious drought of sit down restaurants in this part of town, because this crap would never fly where I live. I cannot tell you how much I am looking forward to NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN.

P.S. They own 3 restaurants apparently: Richardson's, Rokerij, and Dick's Hideaway...all right in the same area (Rokerij and Richardson's being attached). 

P.P.S. They all serve the same menu. It is NOT amazing. I have previously been to Dick's. Yes, it is good. No my socks did not come flying off.

P.P.P.S. ProTip: Drive down to Central Phoenix and go to Durant's, Portland's, Switch, or Fez. All of these places have exemplary service and food to match."
1,"It was my Birthday and my wife, her mom, a dear friend and I headed to Fleming's Steakhouse in Chandler, AZ. We heard only great things about this place and wanted to experience their 'unforgettable' steak dishes. That, we did, unfortunately. 

The restaurant was lovely dim-lit, adequate atmosphere for an expensive steak place. We were seated immediately and tended to by the waiting staff. The small roll of bread and two kinds of butter were good but insufficient for four hungry souls and we polished it up right away. No one offered to bring more. Our waiter told us about the daily specials, after which we ordered food and wine. After a short wait, four large dinner plates arrived. I was the lucky one, my steak (a large  rib eye steak, ordered medium-rare which tasted very good despite two large blobs of fat) was sitting pretty in the middle of the large dinner plate. Nothing else on my plate, just the steak. I looked around at my wife's plate and couldn't believe, her fillet mignon was laying there, in the middle of the large dinner plate without anything garnishing it, be that a glaze, a leaf, a slice of whatever! At the prices asked by this restaurant, it felt like an insult to each of us to have such a poor presentation of a steak!! We asked our waiter for a side dish, mashed potatoes with Parmesan, and when they arrived, we couldn't believe it! There were no more than two scraggly potatoes turned into mashed potatoes, or about a tablespoon of mashed potatoes per person. Mind you, they tasted good, but at over $9.00 per side dish? In short, we left hungry and wondering why we spent over $200 for the entire meal.

Next time, we'll go to a well tried place for steaks and more. Durant's, downtown Phoenix and worth the drive."
1,This was the second time I placed an order over the phone that was delayed over an hour. I was told over the phone that it was going to be only 15-20 min for me to pick it up. I showed up 30 min later and my order was still delayed. I ended waiting for another half of hour to receive my order. The pick up service was the worse I have ever experienced.
1,"One of the WORST experiences of my life.  My friends and I decided to go and check this place out as the local radio kept talking about it.  So the day we decide to go, the guy from the Colbert report was there mocking the restaurant also.  We go in and we thought, ""hey wow, this is kinda cool"" as they talked about monster proportions of burgers and fries fried in lard.  However, once the food arrived we sat down and although the wait staff was scantily clad, all of them had ""cottage cheese"" legs and thighs.  We sat down, and my friend decides to take their super burger challenge, she said if he finished his 2 lbs burger, his meal would be on the house.  He kills it, and when we ask why his burger wasn't free, we could no longer find out waitress and the owner says to us ""you either pay or i come over the counter"" he threatened us with violence, which is stupid as all we were doing was asking what about what the waitress had told us.  We will never ever go there again.  Being Asian, he also spewed racial slurs at us, calling us to go back to where we came from.  ALL of us were born and raised in Arizona so I don't know where we would go.  Anyways, don't go here.  

Also, all of the patrons, ALL of them were middle aged men, who instead of paying attention to their wives and kids were hiding away at a nasty restaurant who's burgers aren't even really grilled.  the frozen patties from costco are placed on a machine that rolls the burgers through, so you can't even want a medium burger, they are all torched.  The fries although fried in lard, are crap.  All in all, if you're a lonely loser, this is the place for you.  If you're a classy kinda guy that wants REAL food, go to any other generic burger place and you will be more satisfied."
1,"I used to love Quiznos.... I would go out of my way to get a turkey bacon guacamole sandwich any day. At this point in my life I will no long be giving any money to this sorry excuse for a sandwich shop. The staff is rude and careless. I was given obviously bad guacamole... Which I didn't realize until i got home a took a bite of my sandwich to have the fowl taste in my mouth. It took 20 mins to get my sandwich, there was only one couple in front me. I'm done with this place. I should have went to paradise bakery across the street."
1,"One star is far more than they deserve.  The owner of the property spent an excessive amount of time barking out reminders of hotel policy, was rude to guests and his staff.  The stay here felt more like being in prison with the warden constantly in your face.  People in the group that stayed were locked out of the room by management, forced to pay made up fines.  The owner ruined the entire experience.  If this is how customers are treated, this place won't be around long."
1,"I am totally baffled why this place gets such good reviews. I have been there a few times because it's close to my work and I received some gift certificates for my birthday. Unfortunately after the last experience, I can't go back.  Although they are very nice and have great prices, I have to reveal the ugly truth: 
1. They don't put any effort into sanitizing the tools or the pedicure bowl. I actually saw them clean the brushes and tools in the water I was soaking my feet in and then just rinse out the bowl after they were done... not spray, soap, nothing!
2. Reason #1 probably explains why my heals cracked so severely after my pedicure that they began to bleed.  I had to use peroxide, neosprin, and bandages for almost a week to get it heal. 
3. They water down their nail polish... so much that it destroys the bond and polish never actually dries. 
I hate to bash a business with good customer service, but these practices are simply unacceptable.  I obviously won't be back. =("
1,"Worst, slow service ever....especially with almost no one in the place. Food was average at best and thats being kind. Skip it if you are looking to eat or get a drink.

Just an update: I (as well as a friend who wrote a review of the day) were contacted (I didn't see my message until today oops) and offered refunds and gift certificates. Now this seems all well and fine-I do appreciate them trying to make the most of the situation-but my friend is still waiting for a refund and/or certificate. So we shall see. If I could take away my star for more non-service then I would."
1,"Great in its day, now leaves a lot to be desired.  Deserves credit as a Phoenix landmark Chinese restaurant.  

This restaurant has been here for 38 years.  I've been going here off and on for 35 years.  I go here more for sentimental reasons, and not so much for the food.  

The interior still retains some of the original decoration style from the original restaurant established nearly 40 years ago.  The rest of the decorations have been torn out.  I believe the decor is modeled after the Forbidden Palace in Beijing - see the vault-of-the-heavens style crenelations in the ceiling.  

I have this restaurant - in its former self - to thank for this:  Back in its day, this restaurant was really great, and the entire atmosphere lent to an ambiance that actually inspired me to study Chinese and then later go live over there for some years. 

Sadly, the food here is not all that good.  The fryer oil they use here is pretty old.  The fried rice arrives looking almost black (from the fryer oil?  too much soy sauce?) instead of a rich golden brown, and tastes overcooked somehow.  The eggrolls are just OK.  Definitely not fresh.

A lot of the menu items from the original owners are no longer on the menu; for example the special ""Chinese cakes"" served on a plate topped with a delicious gravy-like brown sauce and shallots - probably some form of Cantonese food.  All of this is gone, and replaced by very plain fare, and not very good at that.  

If you like salty, greasy, plain-tasting yet somehow edible Chinese food not far from the $1-per-scoop variety, then go here.  Golden Phoenix's heyday as a great restaurant is long-gone.  Let us bow our heads in sadness to a place that once was very good - now passed on..."
1,"I had such high expectaions after reading reviews but I was so disappointed.  The food was not good, the service was awful.  They got all of our orders mixed upo. Will never go back and cannot recommend this place.  PS  one dish was good and some enjoyed the soup.  There are 100 places I will visit before returning to this place."
1,"I took my kitty to the Beat the Heat low cost spay event and she came home with a hematoma in her ear that was NOT there when I took her there in the morning. Surprise, surprise...they can recommend a vet to take her to. I'm pretty mad about this."
1,"First off the woman who answers the phone is not impressive at all.   I called to consign my furniture and when I asked her about some info on the store,, she said "" do you want to consign your table or not!"".  Quite rude.  That was a turn of for me.....
The next day I went in the store for some info but when I entered I knew this wasn't the right fit for my Robb & Stucky table.  The place had older style furniture..dated couches, florals, mauves.  There was one accessory that I would  buy in the whole store.  

Needless to say, I won't be coming back or consigning my table or anything else...rude stuff + gross stuff...what more can I say!"
1,"The portions are too small, the plasticware just reminds me of Jack In The Box, the serving tray is right from a mall food court, and the menu selection is drastically reduced.  You can't really enjoy conversation or relax at lunch listening to the kitchen scream out order numbers to the customers.  The flavor mixing softdrink machine is fun, but gimmicky.  The food quality and flavor are the same for the most part, but you do leave wanting more...

I won't be returning to this location."
1,"Good prices but this please is honestly not worth the hassle. First of all you have to leave your purse at the counter. I am not comfortable doing that anywhere. Who does that? The only place I have ever seen this before was ASU's bookstore. 

Then you walk in this warehouse that has NO air conditioning!!! I made the mistake of going yesterday in the middle of the day (111 degrees out, yikes!) Then you get inside and you have to carry a catalog to refer to for prices since items are unmarked in large boxes. 

If they had a/c it would have been worth it to save a few bucks on the toys my dog destroys in minutes but no air conditioning??? IN ARIZONA?? Madness!"
1,"The food was not particularly good on our last visit there and the service was rude and not helpful at all.  I even emailed them afterwards to give feedback, in hopes that they would redeem themselves by showing some good service that way.  No luck.  Didn't even get a response.

They will not be getting any more of my business.  Too bad because I'd actually had a decent mushroom burger there before and would have been a regular customer.  But the service last time was so bad that I won't go back."
1,"I'd have to disagree with the person who said this restaurant is dog friendly.  I was told off by the owner because I had a little dog outside table and that was right after I finished paying for an overpriced breakfast dish and coffee.  I went here before that on several occasions and many times my order was forgotten, after paying....and the staff is real unprofessional blasting music at nightclub volume at early breakfast and lunch times.  I'm a neighbor, but will never go here again!!!!"
1,"NOOOO!!! 
Don't think about it!!!!

Had my windshield replaced by these schmucks. The morons tore up the interior of my car, and damaged a speaker cover. 

I had to call them about replacing the cover thrice, they finally did, and then I found out that there was a HUGE air leak in the corner. They never fixed the interior trim.

They sent out the same first idiots to plug the leak, and they ended up breaking a ton of clips for a covering on my car, ruining the windshield wiper covers, and DOUSING my tweeter in water. I called immediately after they left and got harassed by a ""manager"" because he just had hip surgery (why is this my fault?!) and couldnt come until a week out!

Whatever incentives they offer are not worth the TERRIBLE craftsmanship and poor service. 
I am exploring my options with a lawyer, and have reported them to BBB."
1,"My boyfriend and I tried this place last year and we haven't been back since. The food was really unspectacular, they weren't really that hot. The price is a bit high since there's a restaurant by the same name on Southern and Dobson that serve much better food for less. The decor was really tacky and they should paint over the mural, it does not appeal to their clientele. Lastly, the staff was not nice."
1,"I've now tried Thai Elephant three times.  My first two experiences were solidly mediocre -- nothing was awful, but aside from one delicious dessert (black sticky rice with pumpkin custard), nothing stood out, either.  As a recent Bay Area transplant, I admit to being a bit picky, but in my 6 months in Phoenix, I've found several places that more than satisfy my rather frequent Thai cravings (Swadee in Chandler, Thai Lahna in Arcadia, Sala Thai in North Phoenix, and, in a pinch, Thai Hut in Central Phoenix).  Until now, Thai Elephant hadn't really done it for me, but since the restaurant is literally 40 feet from my office and since other Yelpers seem to have had positive experiences, I was reluctant to give up on Thai Elephant without giving it another chance.

On Friday, looking forward to a relaxing night at home, I called in an order for Pad Thai with chicken, Panang Curry with beef (extra spicy), and Spicy Eggplant with tofu (spicy, which I thought would be automatic given the name, but apparently wasn't).  I got home, meted out ridiculously oversized portions of the three entrees, and sat down to enjoy my feast.

Wow.  I don't know quite where to begin, but to say that I was disappointed doesn't begin to cover it.  The Pad Thai was about on par with the Taste of Thai boxed dinners you can pick up at the grocery store, only less flavorful; marginal at best, but edible.  The chicken didn't stand out as being of particularly low quality, but the noodles were some of the worst I've had at a Thai restaurant (some bites were underdone to the point of being crunchy, while others were seriously soggy).

Sadly, the sub-par Pad Thai was the high point of the meal by a wide margin.  The Spicy Eggplant was a bland stir fry of soggy, overcooked vegetables and limp tofu.  The tofu appeared to have been fried as a large block and then sliced, and a few small pieces of eggplant were thrown in for good measure.  The Panang Curry with beef was even worse.  Though I ordered the dish ""spicy,"" the curry tasted like straight coconut milk with a few drops of red food coloring thrown in.  The beef was the last straw for me; it very may well have been the worst quality, most gristly meat I've had at any restaurant I've ever been to.  I tried several pieces, and all were similarly inedible.

I really, really want to like Thai Elephant, but after the experience I had, I don't know if I can bring myself to give it another chance -- especially since I've found so many other good Thai restaurants in the Valley and since the second-worst Thai meal I've had since moving here was at Thai Elephant's sister restaurant, Thai Basil in Ahwatukee."
1,"Considering what is considered the 'norm' for workout facilities... this place is WAY behind the times.

This place would be amazing for 1952- it would then be considered clean, tidy, and cutting edge. There are some actual perks about this place- they do have daycare and plenty of mirrors for me to watch my fat jiggle while I run on the treadmill ;)

It's just an utter disaster. When the BF and I originally signed up, we got a couples membership at a newly redone Glendale location and it was worth the monthly membership fee.

This place does not need a 'face-lift.' It needs to be gutted and TOTALLY renovated. You just feel a nasty moistness when you walk in the door- which just gets worse the longer you're there... and is even MORE WORSE during the summer. Guys always have the weight benches dominated. There's never any availability for machines (any kind) from 4-7:30pm, then it starts to thin out. Blah bla bla blah bla.

Considering this is the ""Biltmore"" location... huge disappointment. Fact."
1,"I was so, so hopeful.  October in Scottsdale, yummy, tacos.....Wow!  Rip Off!! $10 Just to get in (what was that for?). No shade unless you were buying a drink.  Most places wouldn't give you salsa or taco sauce with your measly over priced taco. They seemed like the vultures who didn't care about the customer, just the $2 ticket they could grab from you.
  I had to beg for a napkin then hunt for a place to sit feeling watched by the other vultures waiting for me to get up.
I was ready to leave after 45 minutes and my Pepsi had gotten warm, so I had gotten a cup of ice from the bar.   I poured it in, took one drink and as I was leaving to hike back to my car, security stopped me and would n't let me take it out! ""It could have booze in it"".  Well, by then, I was one angry little local. Dumped it all in trash and said to my sweet daughter in law who was about to ""go mad"" with me, ""Get me outta here!"". She had brought her 2 year old, thinking what a fun way to spend a Saturday morning and encourage our local businesses.  Nope.  Not good."
1,Very bad food!
1,"I bought a deal off of Living Social and waited a while to call them, figuring they'd be swamped with business. Now I can't get them to call me back so I can use my deal. (NOTE: There were no reviews of this company on Yelp BEFORE the Living Social deal.) Of course, Living Social is no help - their website says I need to call a consumer advocate in my area. This kind of thing, I predict, will be the demise of every deal-of-the-day site: the company selling the deal bears no risk of having to pay refunds if the business providing the goods or services doesn't perform. I have since cancelled my subscriptions to EVERY deal-of-the-day email out there. Lesson learned about TWO companies with no ethics."
1,"I have been a ""regular"" customer at this salon ever since it opened.  At first it was great!  Clean, relaxing, and welcoming.   After a few months without a manicure or pedicure I decide to treat myself to a manicure this past week.  I went in and a lady did a beautiful job on my gel manicure.  She paid attention to detail and didn't rush through the whole process.  I didn't have time to get a pedicure so I decided to come back the next day.  I only wish that I had her do my pedicure yesterday ... 

The guy who did my pedicure had some sort of infection on his thumb.  I didn't notice it at first because he was using gloves but when it was time for the foot massage he took his gloves off, revealing it.  Tracy was doing someone else's nails right in front of me and clearly saw that he had some sort of sore or fungus on his nail.  It was completely black and it looked like something was growing out of it.    I was shocked that she didn't tell him to at least put his gloves back on.  The ""massage"" that he gave me was hardly any massage at all.  He did the same motion over and over while concentrating on the tv.  Definitely not worth the $25.   The worst part is that he gave me an ingrown toe nail.  The whole right side of my nail is swollen and I just hope that I don't get an infection.  This was by far the worst pedicure that I have ever received. Even though I had a great gel manicure here, my last experience was so horrible that I will not be back."
1,"i called them and they wanted to charge $30 for fingerprints!!!!!  What a joke.  I found a place on the other side of the air park who did it for $10.  Caveat Emptor!  If if could give them a zero rating, I would have.

On the other side of the airpark off of Greenway-Hayden loop is Global Pi Security.  $10 for prints. Their address is 7807 East Greenway road, suite 9, Scottsdale, Az.  globalpi-security (dot) com.  Good luck."
1,"So, there's no negative stars, too bad. Tried ordering take out before actually eating there to try it - good thing, you couldn't pay me to eat here.

The only thing about the Colossal Cobb salad I ordered was the price. $10 and change for lettuce just enough to cover the bottom of the styrofoam with a sprinkle of toppings. Where'd they get their chef, Chili's? What a disappointment. All the reviews say ' a lot of food' ...for who, an infant?

I had also ordered a couple of carmelized cookies as well. Didn't know deep fried, greasy discs of oatmeal harder than concrete were called 'cookies'. Good grief, the bakery wasn't even good! Had to spit those things out before they took out a filling. 

The only good thing about Chandler Chompie's is Jason's Deli right next door."
1,"We had looked to buy a unit here & looked at several units, then decided to rent for a while first.  We've been here almost a year & loved it at first, but have had horrible noise problems for about 8 months & management won't do a thing about it.   The walls here are paper-thin & we our neighbor plays her music loudly at 3am almost every night.  It's so loud that we had to move our bed to the other side of the room and run a humidifier all night just to try to block the noise, but that doesn't work.  We've called security several times, but it never seems to help.  The ceilings are also very thin & you can easiy hear any walking above you.   Aesthetically this place looks great.  The gym is great too, but the construction is horrible."
1,"My office moved to the area so I was driving around and saw the sign "" Best Sandwich...."" Um, no. If you want, I can come in there and show you how to cook a Chicken Cheese steak. First, don't wrap it up and let the sandwich sweat and make the bun soft and chewy. Second, put some meat on there. It was 50% bun.  It should be toasted and crunchy. And price, a 12"" chicken cheese chips and drink was $13..are you kidding me. For that price, I was hoping for the best I ever had. Change it up Capriottis or the word will get out and it will all be over in this very tough market."
1,"After repeat visits it just gets worse - the service, that is.  It was as if we were held hostage and could not leave for a full 25 minutes because that's how long it took to receive hour check after several requests to several different employees.  Female servers might be somewhat cute but know absolutely nothing about beer and this is a brewpub.  I asked if they have an seasonal beers and the reply was no, that they only sell their own beers!  Even more amusing is their ""industrial pale ale"" is an IPA but it is not bitter.  So, they say it's an IPA but it's not bitter, it's not a true-to-style IPA.  Then people say ""Oh I don't like IPA's"" and want something else.  Their attempt to rename a beer/style is actually hurting them.  Amazing.

The menu was not the regular menu, just a small list of about 4-5 choices.  To make it worse, the actual menu on every table was wrong, yet the kept the menus on the tables anyway.  I heard 3 separate tables order the fried raviolis but they did not have them.  

This place is *only* in business because of the location, location, location."
1,"Most horrible buffet I have ever been to.

My boyfriend and I are big chinese buffet fans. A ton of them have raised their prices recently (and, not surprisingly, have been closing down left and right).. so the prospect of a good buffet at 5-8 dollars was absolutely amazing. We read all the reviews on yelp and I had high hopes.

Dear lord. The food is awful here. Inedible. Tastes very distinctly like a bad frozen dinner.  The only thing I remember being remotely food-like was some kind of beef and onion dish.. which tasted a bit like a philly cheesesteak. not exactly asian fare..

I tried really hard to like this place. My boyfriend didn't like any of it either. I don't understand how they have such good ratings. The ONLY thing I like about this place is their dessert bar, because they have toppings for the frozen yogurt. It always annoyed me how so many buffets don't even have sprinkles.. so they've got that going for them.. though I think I'll just go to Mojo or Yogurtland. haha.

In short, I don't understand how anyone can eat this garbage."
1,"omg...hands down the worst chinese food I've ever had anywhere.  Stopped by for lunch with my wife.  I ordered their cashew chicken dish and my wife ordered the pad thai noodles with shrimp.  Barely edible.  Makes Panda Express look like gourmet chinese food.  Prior to Flo's, the distinction of the worst chinese food went to a chinese restaurant in Nebraska...but that's Nebraska.  I'm chinese and live in San Francisco so know a thing or two about good chinese food."
1,I never got a chance to try the food because I was so turned off by the way I was treated. My family and I will be waiting for a table across the parking lot at The Cheesecake Factory.
1,"Bad food, but lots of it.  If you have a hangover and need grease, this is your place.  Other than that, drive a block and eat at Mucho Gusto down the street--now that is real mexican food!"
1,"1 star for service, but the food is not ok :( they literally put 4 pieces of chicken on my taco. I let that go & figured was a mistake. When I went again, ordered different item & same result. Little to no meat. I will not be going back."
1,The Management Group at this location need to make a better effort to control the number of people jumping theaters.  My experience at this theater was one of the worst that I have ever had.  I will never go back to that theater again.  I felt that it was nothing but a complete money grab.
1,"I will make this real easy for you. 

Just go to in-and-out Burger if you don't want to feel gross and poor."
1,Ok I'm very surprised by the reviews on here. I'm not one to want to write negative  reviews but our food was so bad I couldnt help myself. Maybe this place was having an off night tonight but their pizza barely had any cheese on it and the crust was soggy. Unfortunately the pizza was better than the wings that were overly breaded and soggy as well. Thank God we had a groupon and didn't have to pay full price. Won't be ordering from here again. Disappointing :(
1,"It's been a few months since I've been here, and what a change, not for the better. I usually get the same thing to start with, ceviche and pollo asado. Both are usually quite delicious, not this time.

The ceviche had absolutely no flavor to it. As if the chef tried to make it as flavorless as possible. I did not finish it as it was not enjoyable in the least. Now for the tacos. Stale taco shells, dried and overcooked chicken, slopped on guac and no pico de gallo. The tacos were so bad I tried to rescue them by asking for pico de gallo, since they did not put any on, and then I was charged $1.00 extra. Of course, no manager was anywhere in sight. This place simply doesn't care. On the bright side, the margaritas and salsa are still good, but the chips were stale.

Not only will I not return, but I can no longer recommend this place to businessmen from out of town. I see dozens of new business people every day who stay in Scottsdale and they always ask for Mexican food, and I've always said Cien Agaves. No more."
1,"Don't know where I should start. Grand opening was on September 17th, 2010. We went to try this new Dim Sum place at the Mekong Plaza as they heavily advertised in the chinese newspapers and were advertising 30% off.

When I got there, the biggest eyesore is that they tried to make their portion of the Food Court as a regular ""Chinese"" restaurant. So imagine the picture of chandeliers hanging in the middle of a food court in the mall. It just looks too tacky, I thought they should've went with a more fast food type Dim sum like they have in San Gabriel, California.

Upon checking in with the hostess, they don't even issue numbers, they only call you by name. So that was already pretty different from how usual chinese restaurant run things. Totally not efficient at all.

Once we finally got a seat, things got worse.

Our ""Har Gow""/Shrimp dumpling was raw! The skin was thick and clumpy, the shrimp was severely undercooked. We asked them to exchange for another one, and it was still raw. We also had to exchange the shrimp egg roll as it was also raw. Their excuse was that they were too busy and did not have time to fully cook the food. Ok.....so how are the other 100s of asian restaurants able to serve dim sum at a fast pace with fully cooked food? That was probably the lamest excuse.

The trademark ""beef internal organs"" that I always love to order was pathetic. They charged the large price for a tiny little bowl, there were only a few tendons and mostly filled with Daikon. 

The BBQ Pork bun, another staple of Dim sum, was not that great either. There was barely any char siu in the bun, and the exterior of the bun was not fully cooked.

I understand that it is their first operating weekend, but the idea of a nice chinese dimsum place at a food court just doesn't fly in my opinion. They even offer wedding banquets here too. 

I don't think I'll be returning here unless they really upgrade the quality of the food. The idea is definitely novel, but will be a hard sell."
1,"Slowest DRIVE THRU ever!!!! Also the quintessential SHORT BUS Location.

I frequented this location around dinner time since it is the closest to my home a few times and every time it is between a 10-15 min ordeal. When i worked at Mickey D's in the early 90's we had what was called 90 sec HBO( Hand Bag Out), from order to picking up should be no longer than 90 secs. This must not be a practiced any longer.  I have to say hello when I drive up to the speaker due to getting no response. Then I get someone who is rude and say's yes. I order the big mac deal, buy 1, get 1 for a $1. The employee says they do not offer that, I advise their menu out front does. After 5 min of silence and cars backing up I pull fwd to make sure he is still living to see what is up. Total lack of cust serv service, he had to have the mgr show him how to ring it up, no apology or anything. This happened each time I went there. C'mon man"
1,"What was Dunkin Donuts thinking when they took out the selection of donuts and now only offer a choice of 10.  It used to be you couldn't decide which one to get, now you just have to settle for what they have.  This new and improved Dunkin Donuts is the worst.  I will return for coffee when I get the urge...but never for a donut!!  
Oh and another thing...my Dunkin Donuts used to have Baskin Robbins inside...that is gone too...again WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!"
1,"Had to eat here with coworkers for lunch today and was incredibly disappointed. My $8 caesar salad was probably the tiniest I've ever had. Service was slow, the entire table was nearly finished before mine arrived, and staff was unapologetic. I've had side salads larger than the full salad they served me for lunch. Overall a miserable experience and I won't be back."
1,"The music is pounding...

It reeks of ridiculously strong cologne masking young adult male insecurity...

Some guy younger than my kid brother is walking around without a shirt...

Everything is super overpriced for what you get...

In the grand tradition of overcompensation and brand whoring there is a name plastered all over everything...

No one is genuine either in their efforts to help or able to make real eye contact and stop texting...

Is it a bar in Belltown in the late 90s? Is it a frat party? Is it a spring break trip?

No, it's Pimpercrombie & Bitch! Now I remember why it had been at least ten years since the last time I walked in one of these cesspools of humanity and child labor sweatshops. Maybe next time I will wait 20 years...if they make it that long."
1,"just say no.

this place is truly awful. 
too bad it's taking up valuable space on monroe."
1,35 minutes... No food. You be the judge.
1,"Been here for many years but have seen a recent decline in quality service. Felt scolded by the bartender today at lunch. Felt disrespected as a customer. Service sucks stay away. ""bad service = bad review"""
1,"I had never been to Rainforest Cafe and I'm glad that I got to try it because I love trying things at least once; however, this will also be my last time going there. We'll start from the beginning: 

The atmosphere was nice for the ""jungle"" but it was so loud that I could not hear my wife talking to me. I felt that I had to scream at her to talk. Our waitress was nice but didn't check on us often. We barely understood her either because she speak loud enough. We got our drinks (ten mins later) and my iced tea was good but my wife's chocolate shake was gross. Too much chocolate syrup and it was expensive!! We sent it back so she could get water another 10 mins later. Food delivery was quick and my burger was pretty good but it was plain and $12!! Jeez, so expensive for something so plain!!! I got onion rings for an extra few dollars (they were okay but worth the extra few $$$). My wife got an extra plate of fries and they were a few bucks but they didn't give her more than ten! I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and the theme but they are completely over priced!!!! Not worth it at all! The food was mediocre but left me sick that night. 

Not as amazing as I thought it would be after seeing it many times in Vegas..."
1,Not worth the money. Food was average and the portion was small for the price I paid.
1,"Our bartender was rude and impersonal, to start. When my wife ordered a diet coke, you could see her disdain. We saw her once more, when she took our food order, after which she sat in the corner and ate. The remaining staff dropped off our food without a word, and never came back; in fact, I had to flag down the manager to get cashed out. The food was sub par. My wife's Shepard pie was all mashed potatoes, and my chicken strips were incorrect and with the wrong side. Also, my fries were soggy because they had been placed over excess sauce. 

Poor food, awful service, overpriced beer. Visit the Kyrene location or don't go at all."
1,"Beware... use only a credit card so you can stop payment if you need to. ( our sales person encouraged us to pay cash and get a 10% discount ).  Big mistake,  Any problem you're on your own...really... On your own!  We've spent over $3,000 at this store and it has been a nightmare.  Delivery took  weeks longer then our sales person said & our paper work indicated. There was a mistake with the fabric, the paint was mismatched, what was to take 10 days took 3 months.  Not a darn thing was handled properly.  Every call we made to ""customer service"" was routed directly  back to our  sales person. We went back to the store  in person but there is no mgr, no one except commission sales staff and a voice mail merry go round."
1,"So far my restaurant experience in Phoenix has been subpar when it comes to service and this one took the cake. Everytime the server came to our table it was just to do one thing and we would be left in the lurch with our mouths silenced in the middle of asking for something. Finally the food came and it was actually quite delicious, I ordered the turkey eggs benedict with potatoes and fresh fruit. However once again the food was dropped off with no silverware, no condiments and no refills on the coffee. I truly hope the restaurant re-trains the staff or hires a whole new batch, because I am afraid food alone can not keep a business afloat."
1,"I had not eaten in about 12 hours since we were at the hospital having a baby... and this pizza STILL tasted horrible.

Barely average fast food quality and taste. Avoid!"
1,"Hey Thai Elephant! Stop sucking! You used to be so good. Why is my egg roll cold? Why don't I get a fork with my food.... after asking!? Why won't you make me the Tiger on Fire for lunch when I got it last week for lunch?... AND it's on the menu! When did you decide to cut my curry portion in half almost? When did your service start sucking? Hey every person that decided that my two top was not important enough to attend! Why did it take 10 minutes to order my drink and then an additional ten minutes to actually get my drink? By the way, Tiger beer is on your menu. If you are not going to actually offer it, then you need to take it off your menu. I can't believe it's come to this... I used to love you. You broke my heart for the last time."
1,"Food middle of the road... The staff is rude.. Seems like it starts with the owner. I think she makes the staff pay for everything that goes wrong so in turn they dont want to fix issues with poor, wrong food etc.  I think she tends to forget the customers are actually what keeps a business open. For a long time it was the only choice in the area. Now there are multiple choices.  If your in the area Chili's or Connolys is much better choice in my oppinion."
1,"I would not recommend this place to anyone.  I went there looking for a gift.  I received no help.  The girl was too busy helping the wives of the baseball players.  I guess you need a large bank account to receive help in this store. Also, they did not have a very good selection of items. I think I will take my business to other stores who care about their customers."
1,"I found Lisa G's while driving through phoenix with a friend. The exterior looked promising and we prepared ourselves for a treat. We were in for a a shock! We ordered the antipasto plate and while there were serious issues with it, it turned out to be the best thing we were served. I ordered the chicken rolatini (the special of the day) and it was just plain bad! The chicken was dry and under seasoned, the Rosemary potatoes were soggy  and the veggie medley  (squash, corn, green beans, etc.) was over cooked and the juices spilled over into the potatoes. It was one of the worst $17 meals that I have ever had! My friend ordered the veggie salad and it was one literal hot mess. Just horrible food! I see that others had the mini burgers and bowl of balls and found them to be tasty. I wish I had ordered those. As it is this is one place I would never revisit or recommend to a friend!"
1,"Ugh.  My tip-off should have been the Guy Who Saw Me Reading The Menu and came outside to tell me the food was good.  But I was craving Chinese, I work near the COFCO center, and it was threatening to rain.  I scanned the menu, found Kung Pao chicken, and ordered up.  They told me 5 minutes, and they were accurate.  Price was reasonable.  Waiting area was comfortable and well-decorated.  Food was inedible.   I got the lunch special, which include soup, egg roll, entree and fortune cookie.  I couldn't eat any of it.  The soup (hot and sour) was way too sour.  I felt like I would get acid reflux if I ate it.  I couldn't order the fried rice, because it contains peas (I've learned to ask...childhood trauma).  The rice was clotted together and difficult to eat.  The kung pao chicken contained a suspiciously generous amount of meat...so much so that I questioned whether it was actually chicken.  I watch too many movies.  The egg roll was just gross.  It seemed like the wad of mushy veggies was wrapped in biscuit dough before it was deep-fried.  The fortune cookie was stale, and the fortune was even lame.  I would've done better to get soaking wet and hit up Panda Express."
1,"not clean, worst gel manicure ever and ruined my nails--Jimmy finished it --his wife started it.  Nails sanded too thin and they talk to other people and look away while they'e filing, sanding and cutting.  They cut two times now into the side of my thumb nail, which causes it to catch and tear off the same day, or soon.  Their 10 or 12-yr old daughter brought the colors to pick (she is much too precocous to be customer focused--she's narcisstic and I want an adult waiting on me).  They have to open bottles to look at gel color--no samples.  Gel drying machine is sitting on a priority mail box on top of chair in customer wait area.   Pedicure okay.  Won't come back.  This place like many with Vietnamese want your money, they don't understand service (or cleanliness in this one) and why we really come to these places.  They also try and nickle and dime you on price, for instance give you a deal to take off gel from previous manicure, when you're getting a new gel manicure.  They want to use the dremel to sand your nails down to the quick.  How about healthy nails and return visit.  This place I'm surprised stays in business.  Sadly it's not in a category by itself although the others are cleaner.  Jimmy should stay away from nails and customers, and just keep quiet.  The girl might be cute to some customers but I am not coming to have a 12-year old wait on me.  No thank you."
1,Experience with Hostess was rude. Service with a frown. Our waiter had attitude too. It was a birthday dinner and we were in great spirits..so this review is written with clarity. The margaritas were strong-check ok there. The shrimp appetizer was different and very good and $18 for four shrimp. We ordered two mahi mahi dinners (each $24)and they were RANCID. Yup. I said RANCID. We asked if the shrimp fajitas dinner had the same jumbo and they said they would have to charge extra (each entree was priced at $30) we had to pay extra for the beans and rice that they had left on the table-which was cold by the time the shrimp dinner--which came with 5 shrimp and onions.  Poor service with an attitude. Mediocre food to say the least...all over-priced. Never going back.
1,"I've decided to completely write this place off, and here is why you should too:

THREE TIMES I have tried to go here and they have been closed, all the while their website and posted hours say they should be open. If one of you wants to drive all the way here from the suburbs, you'd better call first because this place cannot be trusted. I've wasted my time and spent hungry minutes walking here only to be disappointed. 

Vitamin T will fail, there I said it."
1,"The bill was 150.00 and that was after a free appetizer coupon they sent me via email.  The food was no where near worth the HIGH price!  The service was not up to par either.  I really can't believe people pay such high prices for food that come with NO sides, etc.  I got iced tea to drink and it cost a whopping $6.00.  That's right folks....6.00 for a glass of tea.  What is that 100% profit/mark up?  I paid 12.00 for a soup sampler.  Each of the three soups were in a tiny espresso cup.  My salmon was no better than what I get at Texas roadhouse but it was three times the price.  I would definitely not recommended this place.  If you want a fancy, awesome meal go to Houston's!  The one thing that was great were the rolls (they were free too)!  Don't get me wrong the food is good but not worth the price tag!  You can get just as good food a lot of other places for a lot cheaper!"
1,"Slow service, staff needs more training. There's like 4 managers and none of the know what they are doing, i don't think this place is going to make it. Sorry but you lost 4 very good patrons Saturday night because of your poor customer service"
1,"Quick spot for a mall-made mayo-based California roll. This is where you go to learn how sushi can go wrong.

You've been hard at work doing swipe-and-sign. Perhaps you even dropped a thousand bucks at Neiman's on a worthless Jhane Barnes' sweater and some silk-lined Zanella slacks or three thousand on a whats-left-of-last-season's-collection of Brioni blazer. Whatever your fancy, you're toting a wrist full of roped, glossy, shooshing-sounding bags with tissue paper sticking out the tops. You just want a break and some cool refreshing sushi.

It's OK, but beware. Unagi and other ""hot"" items have a ""beep-beep beep-beep"" before they get to you. California and spicy tuna rolls come real quick -- 'cause they come from a vat of mayonnaise. Rice is not right either. Stick to tuna and salmon sashimi and miso soup.

If head chef Rick is there (think Kyoto of Empire at 24th and Camelback, then Ichi Ban, University off McClintock), ask him to make you a Fat Bob on Acid, for good ol' times' sake. Or just go to Starbucks, tide yourself over, and find a real sushi restaurant.

And about the Brioni... Don't sweat the buyer's remorse. It'll make a great tax deduction to Florence's."
1,"I learned of this company through a living social deal. I emailed them to set up an appointment. The earliest available date was a month later, I went ahead and scheduled the appointment in spite of the wait time. One month went by,  on the scheduled day of cleaning in which I was told they would arrive between 12 and 1... NO ONE shows up. I wait, at 3:30 I email asking why was this scheduled appointment not kept?... I've yet to get a response or an explanation.

There are many cleaning companies out there, my suggestion - try a different one than Maid 4 it all."
1,"I love Mexican food. Today I ate half of a taco and simply had to stop; not in a good way either. The meat tasted like it had been frozen multiple times and lacked flavor. The tortilla tasted like it was store bought and made of paper. The beans were flavorless. The rice was hard and lacked any flavor. Moving to the vegetables: shredded plastic is not actually a vegtable. This is some of the worst tasting, most over priced Mexican food I had had. It would be one thing if it was reasonably priced, but $10 for taco is a absurd amount for a worst than fast-food taste. 

The margarita was good, but $10 for a margarita is a bit on the high side.

The service was average, but I found it odd that my waitress didn't find it odd that only a bite of each item was missing and never asked how the food tasted."
1,"We had read good things about Over Easy, and were excited to try it out. We went a few days after Christmas, and were horribly disappointed.

When we walked in, we were seated by one server. Then, a few minutes later, another host came up to us and asked why we stole a table and did we not understand how seating works? We were quite confused and offended, as we were seated properly and had done nothing wrong.

Then, once we ordered, we waited over 45 minutes for our food. Finally, we asked about it, and then it was out within a few minutes. They had completely lost our order.

When our food arrived, one dish (the Over Easy -- toasted brioche with spinach & an egg) was absolutely inedible. The brioche was so burnt that we could barely cut it, as was the bacon. The fried egg was very undercooked, even though we requested it completely cooked through. I was honestly shocked the server brought us the dish without saying anything, since it was clearly burnt.

The other 2 dishes (banana & pecan french toast, and the Loretta sandwich) were just alright -- certainly nothing to rave about. And, the 3 of us ended up splitting these 2 dishes, since the other dish was awful. We ended up leaving early because we were all so disappointed. At which point, our server asked if we'd like a box for our uneaten burnt brioche. It would have been much more appropriate for her to ask if there was something wrong with it, since it was obviously not eaten.

Anyway, I'm not sure if we just caught them on a bad day, but I would never go back again or recommend Over Easy to anyone else."
1,"I hadn't been to Fuddruckers for about 20 years... now I know why.  Cashier was nice and very helpful.  I ordered bacon cheese burger combo.  Fries were only warm, not hot.  Burger was not very tasty and it was full of gristle bits... you know the ones that stick between your teeth.  Lots of trash on the floor.  After we were finished, someone came to ask how things were.  I told here about the fries and she offered to get me more; I declined.  She offered a free dessert: I accepted.  In all, not a good experience, will probably be at least another 20 years before I go back."
1,"Just because this place is called ""Maria Maria"" doesn't mean they sell Mexican food. Their menu actually says ""Mexican inspired cuisine"" which should have been my clue to leave. The food is border line Nasty!  

The restaurant is cute and sort of romantic but it's so loud in there that it ruins the ""romantic"" mood. I was excited to see they had live music until they started playing some weird pop music. Why would they do that in a ""Mexican"" restaurant?  I wanted to leave but our waitress was no where to be found 20minutes after we finished our meal.

I don't recommend this place for any meal!  

I have only been living in Scottsdale for two months but it seem that Arizona is ""Cougar"" town. The bar was full of them. I'm beyond annoyed with all this ladies acting like they are 21 wherever I go. I'm embarrassed for them. They dress and act young but with that face and hands who are they kidding besides themselves? gee."
1,"Total bait and switch sales department! Will tell you one price over the phone, then quote you another when you arrive! Happened to me personally 3 times. I bought from Scottsdale BMW. One quote, one price, done deal. Buyer beware..."
1,Disgusting!  Had a Groupon so my daughter and I tried it out.  Very outdated and gaudy 80's style interior made me feel like I was in an episode of Sopranos.  The food itself was pretty bad.  We ordered pretty simple dishes but they just had no flavor at all!  After trying it out I'm positive all the good reviews on here are employees or owners creating them.
1,"AMC Theaters has the distinct disadvantage in Phoenix at operating in a town with a high-quality, local provider of entertainment (Harkins) and they really pale in comparison. Tonight we went to the AMC 24 at Arizona Center, which is literally right near our house, but we've been there only two or three times in as many years. Why? Because AMC doesn't offer a senior discount any longer.

For AMC Management -- Did you know that there is a huge population of older people living in condos in the downtown Phoenix location who go to moves three and four times a week? I think it is absolutely ridiculous that I could go to a Harkins and see a movie for $12-13 for two but when it's an AMC Theater, it's $20. Do they think they are so special that they warrant this extra ""tax""?

The theater is generally clean and nice, but the prices on sodas and popcorn are too high, combined with the fact that they don't offer the discount to seniors. AMC, please just fold up your tent and go away. We don't need you here."
1,"The staff of this ""establishment"" are some of the rudest, most condescending individuals I have ever met in my life. They will not give you ANY money, and you will have much better luck at Sunset Clothing Exchange, which is right up the street (Plus they actually have friendly staff). The people who are buying the clothes should not be buyers; judging from the way that they style themselves, they know nothing about fashion whatsoever. Everyone who has stated that you will not get any money from them for designer items is right... they would much rather have trite, ""trendy"" studded vests from Target than a pair of Miu Miu sunglasses.

I was there about a year ago, and one of their young female employees was laughing, snarking and making faces at me. I had no idea who she was. It got to the point where my friend actually pulled her aside and said something. Today, their manager called me something that I can't even print on here. I had never seen him in my life, either. I have never done anything to these people except for sell my clothes to them.

Avoid this place at all cost, they should change the name to Juggalo Exchange."
1,"First off I would like to punch the dip Shit on the food network who said this was the best chicken he ever ate. Yeah the place is filthy, but how they operate their business is redicolus. Service sucks, 49 minute wait for the food sucks, waiting 20 minutes from the first  entree being dropped off until the last person luckily receives their food sucks, being told on the 59th minute of a hour wait for your food, that they are out of your side dishes, sucks, spending my hard earned money at a place that is Ass backwards in any kind of business sense, sucks. At first our group thought it was a joke, then the reverse racism theory was brought up, then we noticed that every table was experiencing the same lack of service. Black, white, purple,orange. They just sucked."
1,"Entering the store is visually overwhelming. There were so many things take in, I thought I'd found my new grocery store. 
I wandered for a good 40 mins checking everything out.... 
After the ether wore I began to realize something. While the selection was wide, it look OLD. 
I raced to the fresh fish and noticed that even packed in ice their little fish eyeballs where cloudy and sunken into the sockets. 
I looked at the frozen section and found some fish that had a sell by date of 02/2010. There was other fish that was packed by the store  with no packed on or sell by dates. There was canned and boxed food past their expiration date. 
I checked out this place on the Maricopa County health department and they had their fare share of customer complaint driven inspections."
1,"I have heard so many good reviews for this place, so who wouldn't try it? I should have taken the hints before I got my meal, that this wasn't a good choice.

Hint 1: Location - It's right next to a smoke shop and a gas station across the street from a mobile park.

Hint 2: Food test - It was nice that I got to sample the food even if the first sample wasn't up to par, the guy wouldn't leave me alone about sampling.

Hint 3: Decor - I know this should never have anything to do with the food, but it felt like I was eating at a cousins house on the bad side of town, wobbly chairs, wobbly table.

I ordered the teriyaki chicken (didn't think it would be bad, I mean who can mess up teriyaki?) With chicken fried rice (once again, how on earth can you mess up fried rice?) 

The chicken tasted like it was frozen and thawed out all day. Such a horrible taste. The fried rice tasted like it too was thawed out, kind of had a gross tangy after taste. There also wasn't any spices or egg in the fried rice, just a bunch of green onion,which technically isn't a fried rice. This meal can be related to something you get in the frozen section at a grocery store.

They also give you a snickerdoodle cookie, that looked like it could be the best thing on the menu, until I noticed it wasn't cooked all the way through.

But the icing on the cake was the gross pube like grey hair I found floating in my teriyaki sauce. 

So the expensive $8 meal was so not worth it, and I 'm sure when Diners Drive Ins and Dives visited, the food was great, but today it was the grossest thing I've ever had."
1,Worst customer service of any grocery store I've ever been in.  EVER!  I'd rather go to any other Safeway or any other grocery store.  I'll drive the extra 10 miles just to avoid this place.
1,"This was my second visit to Arriba's and believe me, it wasn't my choice. I spent the first 26 years of my life in Southern New Mexico and I miss the food like CRAZY, especially green chile. When you walk into Arriba's it's New Mexico this and New Mexico that and the dishes are named after cities and landmarks in the state.

When we told the waitress that in New Mexico green chile sauce doesn't have pork in it she said, ""Well, we say that but it's not *really* New Mexican"" and walked off. What?!?!

The first time there we mentioned this to a Manager and got the same exact reaction. I also asked if I could get a side of plain green chile and was told no. Both times we were being super nice and just trying to start a friendly conversation, had these interactions been better this review wouldn't be here.

I'm far from being a vegetarian, I don't eat pork or beef because I don't like it. Also, I didn't ask about the red chile sauce because I'm not a fan, maybe it's porkless and amazing but I can't speak for that...

I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken salad.  Iceberg lettuce, slimy greens, cooked onions and bell peppers, mushy tomatoes, half melted greasy cheese clumps and very dry chicken piled on a shell... yuck. 

If it wasn't for the delicious fresh chips, guacamole and two 99cent happy hour margaritas I would've been VERY unhappy.  I definitely won't ever be back and this time I mean it."
1,"Ugh. I don't like giving a tough review, but this is a store that needs to address a couple things.

1. The Service: Long lines and unpleasant cashiers. 
2. Outdated Store: This wouldn't be so obvious if they just did a little cleanup and merchandising.
3. Produce: Maybe in this store they should just no offer produce. The little corner in the store makes you think it was an afterthought. 

I think just a couple things that wouldn't cost much money would go a long way in making this store a go to place for me. Not there right now."
1,"I went here with Friends last Friday.  All my friends and I use Yelp, at the end of the meal taking cost into perspective we all came to this is a 1 star place.  It was a huge disappointment after looking at the positive reviews.  Our 1st disappointment came because they had a ""limited"" beer list.  My good buddy just wanted an IPA and all they had was the normal domestic beers and a few other quality ones.  Then, the Spanish ham was not very good and once you take into account the price it was terrible.  We had a sausage plate where the sausage was dry.  The Calamari was extremely oily.  The only positive thing was the lamb chops but once you factor in price that was poor too.  We all came to the conclusion we would never go back."
1,"I ate at Scramble last Friday and I have to say that it was a horrible experience.  What attracted me to this place was the separate vegan menu in addition to their regular menu - this makes things easier when dining with vegan and non-vegan friends.  So I happily ordered a tofu wrap and added fried potatoes as a side and awaited my food.  We started eating and my friend found a hair in his food...not good!  He threw it on the floor and tried to drop it.  Well moments later I found a hair in my food...  I couldn't believe there was hair on both of our plates!  I was so disgusted I could no longer eat my food (and I was ravenous).  I told the girl working the register about the whole ordeal, she walked back to the kitchen then back to the register and completely ignored me (she said she'd come back to my table).  Before we left I spoke with someone else and showed them the hair, clearly not one of mine.  All I got was ""Oh, I'll check the guys in the back.""  Check the guys in the back???  What?  How about, sorry may I refund you your money?  Additionally, the few bites I had of my burrito were pretty bland, it needed seasoning or hot sauce.  Overall, I wouldn't go back...unless I somehow develop a taste for hair, although I'm sure that won't happen.  I did take a picture of my food before I attempted eating it and if you zoom in enough you can see part of the hair sticking out of my food - I'll be posting them."
1,"We went to American Junkie after we found a 50% discount from http://www.restaurant.com. They couldn't pay us to go back.

If you like velvet ropes, not being able to talk to the person next to you because the music is so loud, and being around people who are really into themselves, American Junkie is your spot."
1,"Lots of ""gay on gay"" homophobia here.  Hick bars in Alabama are more gay friendly.  Staff and owners know this but they do not seem to care.  Oh well"
1,"This is a sad excuse for a gay resort.  Sort of like a worn out version of Palm Springs.  We found the Zen Yard up on Maryland Avenue a much more agreeable experience in a better neighborhood as well.  Zen Yard is a far better value, with full breakfasts included and warm, helpful hosts as well, not to mention particularly reasonable off-season rates and hosts who are actually there for their guests."
1,"$8 for a tiny sandwich with one egg, two greasy strips of bacon, and a stale muffin. They say it's pricy because they get it local? It has to have substance to be considered anything. So whack."
1,"I don't think anyone who gave over a 2 has ever eaten Italian food in Chicago. 

I struggled to give 2 stars, but figured the wings were decent .

#1) No celery salt on the Dog
#2) No cucumber on the Dog
#3) WORST OF ALL the GYRO, was not off a spit it was processed
#4) Also, living 30 years in Chicago I have never had a gyro covered in more lettuce than there were onioins. 
#5) Since when does a Gyro (not in Chicago) have Feta Cheese & almost not Tatziki
#6) The PIZZA IS NOT CHICAGO STYLE ITS 100% New York
#7) Wings are a 6 out of 10
#8) THERE IS NO DEEP DISH PIZZA OFFERED OR THICK CRUST???
#9) I apologize they have now gone from 2 to 1 star... 

PLEASE CHANGE YOUR NAME YOU""RE A DISGRACE TO CHICAGO!!!

Don't think I will give this place another shot no reason"
1,I really don't get why everyone is raving this place.  I've been here twice and ordered the carne asada burrito.  The portions are really small for the price that they charge.  There is too much tortilla for the meat.  I think this place is overrated and that there are better places for carne asada in the valley.
1,"Man oh man... I can't decide whether I want to review this place or not under the auspices of ""if you don't have anything nice to say...""

All I have to say is this: 

We ordered food. It came totally wrong. I asked for a vegan salad, not specifically, but that's how I ordered it, and it came with chicken and cheese. This just shows a complete inability to read the order. People make adjustments all the time. I have worked at a restaurant. I have fucked up. I should have been lashed 40 times! Read what people order! 

So when I got the wrong salad and saw what an unbelievable disappointment it was going to be, I ordered a veggie sandwich instead, which, to their credit, they delivered and took off the bill. 

The best customer service in the world could not overcome this sandwich. It was a monumental fucking embarrassment. I cannot believe they let that thing out the door. I ate it because I was starving but I would have liked to have driven it back there and go through it, ingredient by ingredient, with the preparer... Explain to me how this is appealing to the eyes, mouth, stomach, etc.

I just hated it. A lot. 

Sorry, I'm sure you're nice people with good intentions."
1,"What a load of absolutely hideous, uninteresting crap.

Take every single one-star review written by Yelpers below, copypaste them here and you will have a far more eloquent summary of my feelings on this place than anything I can come up with.

I have no reason to ever come here. Certainly not free will. The one time I did come here I was forced to by a friend who was meeting another friend."
1,"Im going to have to agree Whole heartedly. And i informed the manager of it as well. I picked this one because it was close to the Airport and the Light Rail. The noise from the Airport wasnt to bad. But it was the Train Horns all NIGHT LONG and ALL MORNING when your trying to sleep. I wouldnt pick this one, the neighborhood wasnt bad despite what people say. But the Train noise is just unbearable. I got it for the Click 6 rate which was reasonable. Stay Elsewhere. I should of picked one further down that was right off the light rail."
1,"Very unpleasant experience. Creepy male doctor. Uncaring. And no help.

I went to this Urgent Care with a swollen ankle so painful that I was nauseous, dizzy and having vision problems. The doctor interrogated me and advised me to get my head examined. I'm not kidding. 

Mom was right: good doctors don't advertise. This place actually solicits Yelp reviews."
1,I wouldn't send my worst enemy to this place.
1,"Cummings took over the company that we originally used, and since they have taken over we have had nothing but problems.

I haven't seen a single bug in years in my house and as soon as we started using Cummings we've found a bug almost every single day and not just 'bugs' but cockroaches. I called Cummings to ask them about why this was happening and the receptionist was extremely rude saying they didn't do anything wrong. I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. 

Needless to say I will be finding a new pest control company today."
1,"I don't intend to return, but based on the way we were treated by the kitchen earlier this week, my ""uncouth"" self doesn't exactly feel welcome anyway. However, I'm not quite convinced that it's my loss... 

It had been almost a year since my original visit to Breadfruit which did not overwhelm (as you can judge by it taking me a year to make it back) but I did have an appreciation of the option for Caribbean cuisine. 

Since a friend and I were going to be downtown for an event, I suggested Breadfruit for our dinner spot. We enjoy good food and supporting local. The option to pick up wine at the Public Market next door and have the already reasonable corkage fee waived was a bonus, as we had really enjoyed a couple of the Arizona Stronghold wines at a recent FnB wine pairing and thought they would pair well with the Jamaican heat! 

While the scallops were delicious and cooked perfectly, 2 for $12.50 -- $6.25 per scallop -- is a tad steep in my book. We also shared the Jerk Chicken Salad ($9.95) and the Jerk Prawns Off the Grill ($14.95). 

Here's the ultimate rub, the bottom of the menu states ""no substitutions or modifications""... Since when is cutting a KFC-side-sized ear of corn a ""modification""? 

At the same time, the menu describes the restaurant and it's offerings as ""Nothing fancy; simply good food that nourishes and rejuvenates the body."" 

It seems like cutting something in half so we could easily share it -- particularly after the plate has been delivered to the table for us to appreciate it's ""beauty"" AND after we've communicated to our server and demonstrated with the first two courses that we were splitting the items -- is in the vein of ""nothing fancy."" 

How about providing the customer with an appropriate utensil to cut it themselves, then? 

The fact that the chef was obstinate in refusing to cut the KFC-side-sized ear of corn provided with our entree screams ""pretentious and grandiose"" and tainted our entire experience. 

To quote my dinning companion, ""You are not James Beard and James Beard would've cut the corn!"""
1,"We checked out RnR on Sunday (just a few days after opening.) In all fairness, I have to agree with many of the other reviews. Even though they are new, these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein. The building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny Sunday morning. There was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer. The menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items. He was struggling to explain. Our drinks took more than 15 minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time. Our water had just disappeared. Then the food. I ordered the grill cheese ( a rare treat and when I order it I want it good!). It was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread. The cheese wasn't melted. I sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out. Icky. Our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids. It became comical after the third person came out. My husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings. The eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless. We even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and ""come back and try us again."" He made no effort to ""make things right"" either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back. There are too many restaurants in town to have to go to one that is less than mediocre. The young crowd may enjoy it for the bar vibe it gives but the majority of the tables on Sunday am were families or middle aged and we saw similar responses at other tables."
1,"As I promised myself, I'd go back again to try it again. Yyyeeaahhhh...sooooo....the food is still not good. I got the mongolian beef and it's like ""wha? really? is this IRL?"" 

I'm a chinese food kind of a fan, this restaurant, I'm not a fan of."
1,"I'd say I've been to the Clubhouse a few times a year over the past five years or so. Does that make me the most knowledgeable person on the venue? By all means, no. But, there are some very common themes among the shows I've seen here, even though the artists were different genres, different, crowds, and even different times of year. 

The sound quality is terrible. The last three bands that I have seen there (and have seen in other venues as well) all complained that they couldn't get the sound right on their monitors or in the house. To me, that's a major turn off, if the band isn't happy with their sound, are they going to be very motivated to play? Maybe it's a slighted observation, but it seems that the only bands that return to this venue, are the ones that play music, where the sound quality isn't...let's say ""sacrificed or as important"" (metal, hardcore, thrasher, hip-hop, whatever you call it). 

The venue is also hot. I don't read the reviews of others, before I review a location, because I don't want my opinions to be skewed, but I noticed someone said, ""don't wear pants,"" honestly, that's a really good tip. The last show I saw here was in June. I know, it's Phoenix, in the summer, suck it up. But when you exit the venue and it is noticeably and significantly ""cooler"" than inside the venue, we've got issues, can they not afford to run the a/c? 

The answer to that question is, maybe not. The bar is understaffed, and patrons seem to be lined up 3+ deep, all around. Sometimes you've got to spend money to make money. Hire more bartenders, customers get served faster, thus allowing them more time to consume the beverage and purchase more. That means you can sell more, which means you will make more money! What a concept. 

Hate to just destroy a business, but hopefully they will heed the feedback constructively. Until then, remember: if you've always wanted to hear the artist you are going to see in a low-fi format, here's your chance, if you have always wanted to forgo wearing those pantaloons, I support you, and finally, you should craft a clever way to hide a flask, since you won't get served, although this might be difficult sans bottoms."
1,"If it wasn't for the bad food I would go here more than once or twice a year.  The meat was dry and tough in my first entree and not edible in my second. Now when my wife drags me here to watch a movie, I order a salad only. Because they do catering, I have a suspicion that they serve up left over food from catered events to their restaurant customers.  

The service is OK. They have a couple of generic draft beers. Everything is overpriced.  Caveat Emptor if you order an entree."
1,"Received two more messages from ""Iolanda"" this morning.  Thought some of you might get a kick out of reading them.  I'm definitely never going back to 98 South.  Hope this info helps some of you...  BTW, don't you just love orangeheads??  Doling out insults are so much easier when hiding behind a mask!

19 minutes ago: Obviously rebuttal is not your friend but jealously is your neighbor......

9 minutes ago: Thought the drink was for your gentleman friend but your the one that had to abandoned it.....You really shouldn't have your picture posted ......pug!!! I mean easy target....Lets go west side .............yeppie!!!"
1,"I play squash racquet's, a sport favored by the east coast ""elites"" from them Ivy League schools, those snooty Britishers and the Pakistani leisure class:) 

Why they let me play, I'll never know:)

Last evening, we had a little tourney in which a group of us from the Village traveled to the outer reaches of Tempe to play a group from Lifetime Fitness:)

It was a jolly good, show, ever so much fun and our Village group gave the Lifetime group a bit of a ""Rodgering"":)

So it was with happy hearts and high spirits that we headed down the street to the post tourney repast at Skip & Jan's...let me start by saying that the Lifetime group picked this place, and it's almost like they knew they were going to lose and wanted to select a venue that would be the grimiest, greasiest, grubbiest, grossest spot to try to eat...they succeeded:)

Where to start...I know...the parking lot:)

When we arrived, the total Kelly Blue Book value of the 50-60 cars in the parking lot was about $832...we raised that by several orders of magnitude, just by driving in...this parking lot hasn't seen a lot of traffic from the Mercedes/BMW/Lexus/Jaguar crowd (and may never again:)

After I safely parked a block or 2 away, I went inside and took in the look and feel of S&J...crappy old wood paneling...tables and chairs from a circa 1955 high school cafeteria...an intriguing mix of flat panel TV's, regular TV's and OTB results screens (yeah, you can bet the ponies here...the sport of Kings, in a slightly less than ""regal"" atmosphere:)

They must have 20-25 pool tables...faded felt...and a whole bunch of people playing pool (and frankly looking like they weren't enjoying themselves...extremely tight and serious expressions on the faces of the people playing and watching...aren't games supposed to be fun? :-)...I suspect there was gambling going on:)

The smell in S&J can only be described as ""extreme humanity""...the place smelled like it has seen a century's worth of spilled beer, cigarette smoke, BO, vomit, urine, spoiled food and every other aroma that humans create for themselves...remarkable, given the fact that this place can't have been here for more than a few years...how did they do that so quickly? :-)

S&J has menus, they have some sort of kitchen, they have Jagermeister on ""tap"", they have a bunch of beers on tap and they had a buffet (or ""boofay"" for my friend Ryan C) set up for our group.

It was supposed to be a Taco Bar:)

S&J provided a table full of taco ""fixin's""...the centerpiece of which was the taco meat hot tray...Holy Crap, was that disgusting! :-(

They told us it was ground beef, but I know my beef, and I don't think this was it...this was ground ""creature""...possibly some sort of unfortunate non-distinct animal which happened to be near the kitchen when duty called.

I kid, of course...as far as I know, this was indeed, ""beef""...just not very good ""beef"":(

The hot tray holding the ""meat"" looked like a relief map of the Hawaiian Islands...small mountains of ""meat"" rising out of the ocean of brown/orange grease that was the real body of the dish:(

But, I was starving (a banana for breakfast and nothing else) so I tried to make a taco.

I decided to forgo the slotted spoon that everyone was trying to use to fish some meat out of the soupy brine, and use some tongs instead...my idea was to try to squeeze as much grease out of the concoction as possible...I was sort of successful, but in doing so, I probably squeezed any flavor out as well:(

I got back to the table and tried a bite...not good...I added several shakes of Cholla and tried another bite...and that was that:(

One of my buddies had decided to forgo the mystery meat tacos and ordered wings from the menu and offered me one...I'm not sure what the deal with the wings was, but the wing I tried seemed to be boiled (no, not ""broiled""...boiled) and then dipped in buffalo sauce...not crispy, just wet...all the way through:)

Then they announced that Karaoke was going to start soon...and that was enough for me:(

Adding amateur singing to this tableau would have just been too much:)

Still, it's not all bad news...the tires and wheels were still on my car when I was ready to leave...I didn't become immediately ill (although I had kind of a rough morning, this morning).

They say shared adversity can make teams grow together, so I think I should thank S&J for making the Village Squash group nearly invincible:)"
1,"Banfield is okay for routine check ups for maintenance and preventive care. That is why they offer a ""wellness plan"". When it comes to your animal getting sick, I would go elsewhere. It should not be called a Hopital. The doctors are there for profit only and do not show any care for your pet. The vet techs care, but the doctors don't listen to them. This place is lacking ethics when it comes down to making important decisions when it comes to your pets health."
1,"See the huge sign outside that says $2.50? Yeah, that's for shirts only. I was caught off guard when I brought in my skirt and got nailed for about $3.79. As I sadly handed over my $5 bill, the lady at the counter said a lot of people had told her they felt betrayed by the sign outside. No kidding. I had originally been heading down the street to Regal on 7th Ave.--who does a fine job in half the pickup time--for the ""advertised"" fake price here. Trying to make the best of it,  I told the lady at least I'd learned they had an onsite alteration service, and maybe that was worth a buck. UH OH. Picked up my skirt a few weeks later with some Jersey Shore-type chick at the counter, and was told I owed another $3.79. I flat-out refused to pay twice. She screamed at me, chased me to my car, wrote down my license plate and said the police would be visiting. Ni-i-i-ice."
1,"The location has closed (AGAIN).  Not good if you have prepaid washes or other credits as the business has closed.  Some speculation on other sites is that they have filed for bankruptcy again.

Don't bother stopping by to use their services as the facility is cordoned off and a big sign says ""business closed""."
1,"marginal sushi meets uncomfotable seating.  we used restaurant.com coupon and got stuck wtih an 18% tip...with no service, seriously???  felt scammed...think we actually spent more based on that tip than had we just paid full price.  avoid this one, just not worth it."
1,They wouldn't honor pet co's online sale prices.  That's the first time I've heard about this.
1,"I love Saddle Ranch for its casual night time festivities (including watching people ride the mechanical bull hehehe), but I cannot ignore the fact that the food was disgusting!

When I think of my meal this past Friday night, I think of two words: dry and cold. The spinach artichoke dip was just okay - a bit on the dry side and not very cheesy. The onion rings were just okay was well as the batter reminded me of the chicken nuggets at McDonald's, maybe even worse. The BBQ burger (turkey patty) was dry and tasteless as was the bacon. Really? It must take true talent to cook bacon tasteless. There are a few things that the menu has going for itself - a few very unique and fun desserts and drinks that I have yet to see elsewhere. I am fond of the giant pile of cotton candy and, though I'm not much of a beer drinker, the beer tower looks pretty badass.

For me, I came and will continue to come for the fun atmosphere, but I will definitely be staying away from the grub. Adios, cowboy."
1,"Cold, under done chips. If a Mexican food restaurant can not get this staple right how can I expect them to get much more right.  I arrived for a party that my autocross group was having. Every table had chips and salsa on it. Sombreros were used as the server platters. Senor I don't think this even meets health code. 

Dinner was served Buffet Style, one of the dishes was called ""fandito."" I can't think of a less inspired dish. It was simple pasta with some Mexican flavors thrown it, a dish that your mother would make if she had leftovers from Mexican Italian nights. 

I like really like Mexican food, however I left this place hungry as I did not even want to try any of the dishes other than the salad."
1,"I had the misfortune of stopping by this establishment today with two things, a skirt and a cloth handbag. I asked the woman at the counter if I could have some very minor stitching done on a cloth purse. She looked it over for about 3 seconds and said 'Oh no I don't see how this could be repaired'. (what I wanted sewn were two little pom poms attached to the cloth strap that were loose and I wanted them to be stitched on there tighter). Not a difficult task. She then told me that she could maybe 'send it out' and have it stitched but it would take a week or more to get it back. WHAT??!
I then asked her about  the skirt which I wanted cleaned and/or pressed with the tags attached (because I'm selling it). She said no that the tags would be destroyed in the process. 
So I went to another dry cleaners and asked the same things for both the skirt and the bag. I was informed that what I wanted done would be no problem and that I could pick it up the next day."
1,"ok, let me be straight with you. i hate paying full price for anything. yes, i'm one of those people. i love a coupon. i love a discount. and i absolutely love a bargain! but i don't like to feel dirty when i leave a store. i felt really, really dirty when i left this store. ewwwwww. this is a yucky ross. dirty, dirty, dirty! the floors and clothing racks were filthy. i couldn't have bought something even if i wanted to because the store was so gross - i got black ""stuff"" on my hand after touching a clothing rack. the floor was so discolored i'm not sure what the original color was. parts of the store's floor were sticky. many of the clothes had indistinguishable marks on them, presumably from the dirty hangars and racks they are stored on. selection was meager, there wasn't a single shoe, bag, wallet, sock or home decor item that caught my eye. the trip was a waste of an hour that i'll never get back. never, ever again."
1,Not only was the music the worst I have ever heard the wait staff was as annoying as ever! Like a wanna be swanky place in a strip mall that smells like fish and plays horrible music. Food was so so but over priced for what it was.
1,"Ok..I told Amanda that anyplace that serves beer would have a tough time getting less than 2 stars from me...I wish there were 1.5 however. 

As covered by Amanda this bar is about as straight as they come..this bar personified would probably call bars with any hippness at all the bad F word for gay folk. In fact this bar would most certainly over-use that word. 

Does Puddle of Mudd, Disturbed and POD know that their songs are available in karaoke form? Do they make money from them? Who was the first person to say damn man I can not wait to scream this song to the MIDI music only version over some beers this weekend.

I had a good time...but I tend to make the best of things. There was far more facial hair than head hair. I hate phonetic spellings.. Oh lord don't ever make me go back.

...eff it...I changed my mind. 1.2 stars and I am rounding down."
1,"The absolute worse service I've encountered. My boyfriend, son and I sat at a tepan table, we were ignored for a good 15-20 minutes until my boyfriend had to ask the manager to please have someone get us something to drink. Once we had our drinks, it took another 20 minutes to order our food. By that time, another family sat at our table. My son & boyfriend ordered a meal from the tepan menu, I had sushi. Everyone on that table got their meal and I still didn't get my sushi. I asked the server to please bring it and she brought someone else's order, I had to wait another 20 minutes for my sushi. The family on our table were so upset for us as well. 

The food is excellent, the service is so poor I am disappointed. I advise anyone who comes here to sit at the sushi bar and deal with the Chefs, they are great. I talked to the owner and she was just as bad as the servers. 

I then gave it another try. I met my girlfriends there. We had dinner, spent over $200. We then moved over to the bar area and were completely forgotten about. We asked the manager/owner to please have someone come take care of us and we were told that they were concerned because we were drinking and had kids with us. One of my girlfriends had her kids but she was not drinking. I was offended that she tried to cover up the poor service with her so-called concern. 

Again, food is great service is lousy. I am so disappointed and will not go back. I will look elsewhere for my Caliente Rolls. I hear Blu at the Wigwam is really good and servers are hospitable."
1,Ok food. Super slow!! 3 employees and 2 customers and I could not believe how long it took for a quesadlla which was cold when I got it...the tacos were decent though....Give it a try and you decide though..
1,"Nice facilities, nice AC, but two FATAL flaws:

1. Children running around yelling and screaming at all times.  This is a failure of the parents and, more importantly, of the staff who apparently REFUSE to enforce any kind of policies against noise whatsover.

To parents and staff: THIS IS A LIBRARY *NOT* A DAYCARE!!!!!


2.  The ""collection"" here is 90% DVDs and ""Dummies"" books with trashy novels thrown in for good measure."
1,"Glad this place has new ownership... I should probably remove the review below, Its really harsh and doesn't apply to the NEW establishment.  You have been warned ;)

Short Review:

THIS PLACE SUCKS BALLS

Long Review:
We were supposed to meet a friend here at Draft House on Saturday night. We were excited to be out on a date-like experience cuz its been a while. We went to my in-laws for dinner and then headed to Draft... I knew it was going to be interesting from the sound of the music as we pulled into the strip mall. 

The music: Good music, probably the only good thing about this place - if you're a hip-hop fan. All hip-hop, all night. 

The crowd: Ghetto fab all the way! Seems like everyone there is late 20's - early 30's (and some older sprinkled throughout the crowd) and none realize its not 1996 anymore. Expect to hear a lot of fake accents a la Da Bronx and a lot of misuse of slang terms. It was entertaining until it became annoying. Oh and people WILL steal your seats or tell you they are saved - ugh!

The atmosphere: small, crowded...  Small dance floor.  A couple pool tables, but don't expect to get one. Some TVs playing various sports, which I guess qualifies this place as a ""sports cafe""?? 

The service: OMG, we had one beer each and the ""line"" was retarded, over 30 minutes to tab out. No line in sight, just people crowding together, trying to get to the front of the line.  Oh! and LOL.. the bar tenders are total morons, one of them complained to the guy next to us about his crappy tip and the other argued with his customer about whether they ordered rum and cokes or redbull and vodka.  The guy had already made the rum and cokes and was pissed that HE got it wrong.  Weirdos!

If any of this appeals to you this is your place! 

BTW her friend didn't show and we ended up going to Skip n Jan's to play some pool :o)  We had a great time there :o)"
1,"What a crap airline!  If I could give them zero stars I would.  I flew from Phoenix to Denver to New Orleans.  The check-in people, gate staff and flight attendants were rude and abrupt, the flights ALL left at least 45 minutes late, it was the worst flying experience I've had.  I was fortunate thta my Denver back to Phoenix leg was US Airways...never thought I'd say ""Thank you US Airwarys"" for at least that part of the flight not being a nightmare!  I will never fly United again!"
1,"I've never had a hard time at a sonic before, except for this location. They barely speak English, they don't know their own menu, and they messed up my order 2 times. Come on, your job can not be that confusing..."
1,"The guy who worked the front door Sunday night deserves to be fired. 

Sound harsh? 

Not at all. Had a supervisor overheard how he treated my friend he would have agreed.

We pull up in the car.  It looks fine from the outside so we send in one of the five of us in to scope it out (check the menu, see if there's seating etc). Normal behavior. 


So my friend K, approaches the guy at the door and asks ""what type of food is served here?"" expecting a simple response like  ""American"" or ""here let me grab you a menu.""

Ready for this...?? 

His response: ""human food""

HUMAN FOOD?!?!?!

HUMAN FOOD!??!?!

K is just an average potential customer, asking a fair easy to answer question.

Okaaaaay. Being the sweetheart K is, she goes with it (it: him being a meeeeeanie) and asks if there is outdoor seating.

He sarcastically, mockingly and and outright D-bagly points out how there is a seat yourself sign right nearby. 

How was this guy ever hired?

Again a more appropriate responds (TOOL:) would have been ""yea, the patio seems like it has some space tonight, AND I'D BE HAPPY TO GO CHECK FOR YOU"" or ""at this fine establishment it's seat yourself but usually the outside turns over quickly.""  Sunday night's fine joke machine at the front door: I could happily give you several other decent responses you could have said to an innocent patron.

Everyone and their mom has had some turn at being a waiter/hostess/manager/bartender etc etc in the food and hospitality industry, be it in AZ, SF, WHEREVER and KNOWS the #1 101 rule is: 

BE KIND TO THE GUEST
(kiss@$$ , the customer is always right etc.)


Add to that list: answer straightforward questions from your guests with flat out, non-acrimonious answers!

Granted this review can say nothing about this establishement beyond the front door because we never made it that far."
1,"Be VERY, VERY careful asking for a sandwich as a wrap. I ordered a ham and cheese make your own sandwich, ordered it as a wrap to go. I got home, there's lettuce and mayo and... what this? what's this I see in this sandwich? there's the cut-off fingertip of someone's glove lodged between the lettuce? (At least I hope it's the finger tip of a glove - I'm not even going to think of the other thing it could have been.) Ewwww.... gross.... I didn't finish the sandwich. Memo to self: Don't ever get wraps from Einstein's, particularly not the one on Shea. Disgusting. If it ever happens again, I'm calling a local news station to report it, then I'll call the state health department. Gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross... if you can't deliver sanitary wraps, THEN DON'T PUT THEM ON THE MENU. Not a place to go if you like wraps."
1,"I think chef Silvana Esparza first located the restaurant here on CALLE DIECISEIS (she renamed the street all by herself, apparently) to take advantage of cheap rent.  There was no way she was going to locate her Scottsdalish restaurant actually in Scottsdale.  So, people from the wealthier areas - and some First Friday urban hipsters whose parents foot their bills - make the trek down to CALLE DIECISEIS to partake in everything Barrio Cafe.  And they think it's cool that they are going there, past the check cashing places, the people waiting at the bus stops and the ""rawness"" of this part of central Phoenix.

And what is everything ""Barrio Cafe""????

Pretentious service.
LOUD dining room.
NO parking.
Fusion food that is about 10 years past its prime.
High prices.

Let's talk a little about the last item on the list.

Besides using vulgar language in her YouTube videos for pseudo social activism, Esparza seems to have forgotten her own humble upbringings.  It's ironic that the very people who live on and around CALLE DIECISEIS cannot afford to eat in her restaurant.  The Mexican immigrants and their sons and daughters who do the cooking, the cleaning, the landscaping and all that for Phoenix are not welcome at the Barrio Cafe.  I know that this is not a taco truck, but there is some overwhelming irony here that you locate your restaurant in a working class area and supposedly have sympathy for the plight of the downtrodden and the neighbors can't even eat  at your restaurant.  I guess that's capitalism.  Like that new car, by the way."
1,"La Grande Orange Grocery has a problem. It can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up, and that makes the overall experience iffy. Is it a quick mart? A grocery store? A restaurant? A coffee shop? Unfortunately, it can't be all of them.

I love La Grande Orange Pizzeria, when there is table service, fun wait-staff, and delicious food. But during the day on the weekends, the Grocery is too busy and unorganized to tolerate. It is not set up for the crowd, they do a poor job of line management, and when there is a line to order, the rest of the Grocery is impossible to navigate. To top it off, the counter staff shouts at you when your food is ready. Unnecessary.

I'll certainly be back at night for the pizza, the delicious wings, and to partake of the best gelato shop adjacent to LGO. But I'm afraid that I won't be back for the weekend chaos."
1,"So, what kind of place serves chicken fingers and NO Ranch dressing?????? The only sauces they had was honey mustard and ""Canes Secret sauce"" Can I say EEWWWW!! I thought that the sauce tasted terrible. I am not too big a fan of honey mustard but I do On occasion eat it if there is nothing else And that wasn't even good! The coleslaw was awful also. I do have to say that the chicken fingers were very juicy but also very bland. Those were the only 2 items that I tried, not that there were really any more items  on the menu, Texas toast? And Fries I think?? Overall, I would never go back."
1,"My husband and I heard great reviews about this restaurant and we decided to give them a shot. One word can describe this place GROSS!!! The food sounded great but then you took a bite and ewww disappointment. The salsa was lame, the chips stale. There were only two good things about this place the soda and the waitress was nice. Other than that don't waste your money GO TO ABUELO'S...it may be on the west side but it never disappoints."
1,"Let me start by saying after my experience I surly wish they had half or quarter stars and I am not often found with a lack of words but this is going to take some effort to stomach.

Strolled into this establishment at about 1:30 am, now to their credit I fully understand the crowd on mill at these hours so I lower my levels of expectations..

Place is moderately busy as we walk in, I get to the counter, order some pepperoni pizza and a pretzel with 2 drink cups. Second drink cup is forgot after they ran out of the dispenser, after I remind him he gets a fresh stock of cups to replenish his dispenser but first takes his hand, fingers placed inside the cup and hand me one. Yuck.. Gf didn't catch it so I gave her the first cup and took the lingering finger taste cup as my own.


Fast forward a few minutes, guy is in there , his friends are loud and his face is cut wide open from who knows what incident.. He is arguing and finally his friends get him out the door. Now if I ran this place that guy and his yelling and problems would have been asked to stay, his hands Nd bloody shirt bumping and squeezing past people was discussing . But.. Let's let that go because it's busy and again this is MIll and it is 2 am..



Fast forward 10 minutes.. Tell the guy the ice machine is out, several minutes later.. They fill it.. Again it's busy, no big deal on that one, and with the high temp in the place maybe it killed on the fingerprint bacteria in my cup while we waited.. ""I'm a wishful thinker""

Several more minutes go buy of people bustling past, smearing nastily cheese wish sandwich wrappers all o over the floor as We walked by ""place was trashed"" I go back up and ask the guy for our order.. He said"", oh sorry forgot"" I was amused but it's just sliced pizza and a pretzel.. He tosses them in the oven, and a couple minutes later I get them. Well pizza had obviously been there forever but it was pizza, pretzel was hard as a rock and couldn't eat it.


Then the show starts.. there had been a few people in there, that obviously knew the gentlemen working the register, the flooding actions are the cause for this reviewing of the above..

Short list

-employee is wiping his sweaty face by hand, receiving money..then is prepping pizza with topping BY BARE HAND.. Placing it in the oven, all with out gloves. This occurs over and over, then when his friends arrive there is a round of hand slaps... Um.. Where did these guys come from, did they wash their hands?, eww.  So in the 45 minutes I am in here,no hand washing, no gloves..his hands on food, toppings, money, hands, face, along with all over surfaces possible. Freaking DISGUSTING.

But it gets better.. His friends that he is conversing with are about to ice the cake..  One of them this red headed guy is reaching behind the counter near the pick up, and grabbing fries out of the Bin with his hands.. This happens no less than 10 times..

Another one ask his to meet them in the bathroom... Um what? Yes.. That locked bathroom father 1 am that is closed off to customers.. Hmm my imagination can only wonder what brief activity occurred in the restroom. could my dazed and non health conscious server and front man for this business also be doing drug's one can only speculate. His actions after reflected a very relaxed and dazed person.

Where I will give this guy a couple points, is end of the night he started picking up the place as it had slowed, well this obviously is his job and they have to clean up at the end of the night anyways..but was surprised at this point. 

At this point and my food not eaten we are done being entertained by watching all this and he asked to take our plate at which time he noticed I didn't eat much. He asked if the pretzel was not good and I choose this time to politely tell him the reasons above as why we didn't finish. 

He took it in stride, with no attitude but said simply they got busy and backed up. I do appreciate that but honestly there is ZERO excuse for even a small percentage of the actions to have taken place. I see this as a health risk and was more comfortable at taco stands in Mexico than this establishment. 



In short, I'll be contacting the owner of this location. 

I do realize this is a late night food offering, I do realize the clientele, but I also know this is unacceptable and some poor guy who is mismanaging this place needs a wake up call.


I will be back very soon, if anything just to see if changes are made after I voice my concerns. If needed ill be happy to forward my videos to the county health inspector.


-Thanks for reading this little novel."
1,"We were so disappointed!  We were on vacation in Scottsdale and wanted to try a Brazilian restaurant.  It was nothing like the one we have had home.  Actually it was completely worse than all three Brazilian steakhouses we have close to home.  I tried about 12 different meats and I think there were only 2 out of the 12 that were tender.  The rest were over cooked or hard as a rock.  We really wanted to love this place as I kept trying more and more of the meats as they came around hoping the next one would be better.  Besides being hard, the meats didn't have much flavor.  The salad bar was okay and I don't know that I would even pay the cheaper price to just eat from their salad bar.  This is sad that I have to say the highlight or our meal was the fresh bread and salami slice you get at the salad bar.  :("
1,"UNBELIEVABLE!!  so enraged and appalled!!  i took my 91 yr old mom in to the salon for a mani-pedi.  after the pedicure she had the manicure and she asked for french tips.  the GIRL claims she asked mom if she wanted gel nails -- she's 91, did not understand the gal's ""english"" and can't hear, so i presume she nodded.  after mom paid the charge of $60 and i picked her up (i had another appt.)  she told me about the charge and said she had never paid that much for a mani-pedi.  i called and was told the normal charge is $30 w/$5 added for french and HE said to come back cause it was mistake.  we did and the whole group of technicians said it was mom's fault for saying ""yes"" and would not concede AT ALL -- not in the slightest.  i found that to be awful and mom felt very taken advantage of.  i will NEVER return there and i caution any hearing-impaired customers to not use this business.  TO ME and of course to mom, it was such a slam on the elderly. mom is a visitor from the east coast and at her age does not need to be treated that way.  VERY BAD BUSINESS!!!"
1,"You want good food? You'd be better off smuggling goat cheese in your boot and risking an anal cavity search for doing so than eating at this airport.

You want scenery? Try desert.


You want a comfortable seat to wait for your delayed flight?  Well you are in the desert so you'd probably better off finding a cactus and straddling it face first.

You want a relatively close connection for your flight? Well tough shit.  Oh yeah, they've got people movers but somehow they have this magical ability to disengage people's legs.  Yeah I know it sounds crazy but as soon as people step on to these things their legs stop moving and they plant their fat ass right in the middle of the walk way.  Whats wrong with your legs you mammoth!?"
1,"I am leaving this store angry and can't resist writing a review! 

The staff is incredibly useless....if you can actually find someone to help you. The store is huge with very little signs to guide you. Therefore I always wander aimlessly looking for the one simple thing I stopped in for (even though I tell myself I will never go back) with no one to help me. 

Today they were out of an item I bought last week and need more of to finish my project. I asked the only 100 year old lady I could find to check the back and she told me they have nothing in back and to ask customer service. The lady at customer service was actually a reasonable age and when I asked her to call the Indian Bend store she handed me their number and said ""well you can call them"". I stormed out soooo mad and this time I promise to never go back. Hobby Lobby or Michaels is worth the drive!!!"
1,"The food was decent, however I am writing about their underhanded business practices.
I ordered a travelzoo voucher for $69 that included 2 3 course meals. It said ""Regularly $140"". What we ordered, if had been ordered off the regular menu would have been about $100. However, we were charged tax on the full $140. 

Second, even though on the voucher it says ""PLEASE TIP ON THE FULL VALUE OF THE CHECK."" (which implies tip is not included and we get to choose the tip amount) and nowhere mentions automatic gratuity, 18% gratuity (18% of $140, even though we ordered $100 worth of food at the most) was automatically added to our check.

Third, even if you had ordered the most expensive options, the highest possible amount it could be worth is $120, not $140. It is mathematically impossible to have the voucher be a $140 value, but that is what they add tax and tip to.

Fourth, after we told our waiter we were using a voucher, he seemed less interested in the service level of our table, which i later realized was because he had a guaranteed 18% (of $140) tip.

I just noticed today they have another travelzoo deal ""$79 - AWARD-WINNING FRENCH DINNER FOR 2 W/WINE, REG. $165"", I am posting this so hopefully if anyone is thinking of buying that voucher, they will read this first before they purchase it."
1,This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but the service went way down hill.  The new owners hire lots of college students with tattoos everywhere as well as lots of piercings.  Seems like tattoos and too many piercings are a job requirement along with disrespect and a lack of desire.  The staff is what made this place the worst restaurant ever and doesnt seem to matter how often you let management know I just dont think they care.  Also in the past few years there is a growing number of homeless that sit out front begging for money.  They sit so close to the outside patio that you have them dining with you or at least it feels that way making you incredibly uncomfortable.  Our last visit we sat on the patio which was next to a bench just outside the restaurant where a few homeless were stationed.  One girl had a huge rat on her shoulder and it was beyond disgusting.  Management obviously doesnt care and does nothing to improve anything so we go way out of our way now to eat at the other Greek in Chandler at Chandler Mall.
1,I was not impressed. The food was bad & expensive. The wait is ridiculous. Don't go.
1,We ordered.  I had to return my chicken tenders.  Undr cooked and rubbery.  My wife ordered a hamburger and is now home throwing it up.  what a horrible experience.  We have been huge fans and now this?  I called and spoke with someone who barely has a grasp on our language and they said they would get right back to me.  Still waiting My wife is in bed looking so sick.  We will never return!!
1,"Bad experience...Terrible service, terrible food.

First of all, I was organizing a Happy Hour and Dinner for a retirement party that we had on Friday, August 3rd, 2012.  Reading the fine print on the website it did say that happy hour prices were in the bar area, although because it was a party of 30 we could not fit in that area.  One of the attendees called the restaurant and spoke with the Manager which he confirmed that we were going to have happy hour prices. It turns out when we got to the restaurant they thought we were another party for 40 people that booked the spot for happy hour, but the attendee that spoke with the Manager was misinformed and they only gave us one round of happy hour prices.

Second of all, our server was awful.  There were a couple of servers that actually waited on us because there was a table of 10 people.  Anyways, she took wrong orders and did not listen to our needs and was rushed, rushed, rushed.  Then a new person came in late on our table, and she was not even served when she saw her.  We had to track her down. I am sorry but the amount of restaurants that I have been to, this was the worst service ever.  I mean I had servers that actually new who was new at the table and took their order once they arrived.

I ordered full size of fried green tomatoes, 1/2 order of fried okra, and a plate of sweet potato fries.  The server gave me my fried green tomatoes, but gave me full size of fried okra and the sweet potato fries was horrible.  So I had the server take my sweet potato fries because it was awful.  The server took it away without even asking me if I wanted another batch. I don't cook much, but I probably can fry those tomatoes alot better than the restaurant. I told the server I ordered 1/2 size of fried okra, and she said ok and brought it back to the kitchen then she brought the same dish back and said that she will just charge me for the 1/2 size order.  

And lastly, when the server gave us the bill, it was all separate checks and did not even do that right.  The server was putting stuff on the bill that did not even belong on the check.

So needless to say...I AM NOT COMING BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN."
1,Nasty workers and over priced trash
1,"I give this place NO stars. They have karaoke which would be good except for the co-host is NASTY! The rest of the bar is typical with darts, pool and poker. The food SUCKS! don't bother to go here unless you like being whined at by a wussy faggot at night long. I know that is harsh but the co-host really is nasty."
1,"Walked in during late lunch hour. Did not get acknowledged for about 5 mins. When I finally got sat down, and served my salad, I found a hair in it. Got no apology. Just a sigh firm the waitress when she took it away. You can't pay me to go back here. The waiters are rude."
1,"They served us stale rice.  Average main dishes, not as flavorful.  Not enough meat in the lamb dishes.  Overpriced."
1,Made me and my bro sick. Tasted good at first but something wasn't right.
1,Honestly I don't get it.  I went to Dos Gringos with a good friend of mine last weekend.  I had never been to Phoenix before so I was excited to see what the city had to offer.  After entering Dos Gringos we sat at our table for 21 minutes before a waitress came to our table.  She brought us 2 beers and never came back. After 40 minutes we decided to check out a new bar since we obviously weren't welcomed at Dos Gringos.  So we went up to the bar where I waited for 5 minutes so the bartender could take some pictures and shots with her friends.  What I didn't understand was there were maybe only 20 people there and at least 6 people working.  If I was the owner or manager I would be embarrassed to say that you run that establishment.  I will never return and I highly recommend you stay away from Dos Gringos as you will be disappointed.
1,"I usually do not complain about bad food but the fish and chips gave my wife a serious case of food poisoning.  So if some manager reads this please check out your fish supply or change the cooking oil.  She never gets sick and has been sick all day (December 29, 2012) from the meal eaten December 28, 2012."
1,This place is not there anymore.
1,"I'm sorry to be what seems to be the lone one star review.  Either I got there on the worst day in their history, or everyone drank the Koolaid, or I just have different expectations and taste buds.
It seems like a great idea.  It's a build your own burger joint, $7.00 gets you a cooked to order burger with one cheese, up to 4 toppings, and 2 sauces with fries or onion rings-or some other choices.  They also claim that the beef is local, hormone free, etcetera....

I chose a rare burger with American, grilled onions, sauteed mushrooms. tomato and lettuce, with mayo and mustard on a potato bun.  I added bacon for a dollar.

First, let me point out that if you are in a hurry, DON'T GO HERE TO EAT.  I waited exactly 39 minutes for my food. This would not be a big deal if:
1.  I had been warned before they ran my credit card--what if I only had 30 minutes for lunch??
2. They had places to sit but it's tiny and full.
3.  They had magazines, a jukebox, ANYTHING to entertain you for 39 minutes.  You can't even get your drink early to sip on that.

At the 30 minute mark, I'm ready to eat cardboard with a little ketchup on it, so maybe they make you wait so everything tastes even better?
Anyway, before my burger comes up, I notice that the lady behind the counter is saying that the orders overwhelmed the kitchen.  I look in the kitchen---they have ONE GUY TRYING TO DO ALL THIS??????   He'd better be getting a share of the profits!!!!!  Now I'm jsut feeling really bad for this guy back there.

I finally get my burger!  YAY!!  I'm SO excited!  All those 4 and 5 star reviews!  I take a bite and....the patty shoots out the other side of the bun like it had been shot out of a cannon.
WTH?  I look at the patty.  It's clean as a whistle. I mean there is no mayo or mustard or cheese smeared on the patty.  I turn it over and it slides out of my fingers back into the basket.  The other side is clean too.  The freakin' burger was so greasy, it slid all over the place!  Then a greasy glop of what must have  been the mushrooms and onions slid out.  Still not seeing any cheese, mayo, or mustard anywhere.  Just oil.  Tons and tons of oil.  I open the bun,  On one side is a heavily oiled slick of lettuce glued to the bun by (I am guessing) a slice of cheese.  The other side of the bun has some mayo and mustard residue--and more oil.  I'm grossed out, but hungry.  I take a bite.  It's not rare,  It's well done and oddly, tastes very faintly of liver.  BTW, remember the bacon I paid a dollar for?  Not there.  I'm really puzzled that instead of cheese. or beef, or SOMETHING, I just taste that faint livery taste. So I take another bite.There isn't even any salt or pepper, or anything on the burger patty.  This is perhaps, the worst grade of meat available for human consumption.  I take a third bite because that second bite brought back a memory of when I worked for a meat company here in town.  Now I recognize the flavor.  I'm not saying that what I ate that day at Two Hippies was old dairy cow, but that's EXACTLY what it tasted like.

At this point, I turn to the fries.  The are shriveled and DARK and taste like they've been fried and then microwaved.

I couldn't get out of there fast enough!  Forget my danged dollar!  just get me in the car!

Exactly one hour and 20 minutes later, I had vicious diarrhea

I haven't had that trouble even with eating junk food at the fair!

No.  NO.  A thousand times NO!

Red Robin is my next burger stop.  Period"
1,Not lesbian/gay friendly at all. I should have read the previous review before going.
1,"Cadillac Ranch looked really awesome from the outside, this nice red cadillac out front, nice patio outside, and an enclosed bar and grill patio on the side. Upon entering it was pretty dead, well, it was a Monday afternoon after all.

I ordered the Southwestern Country Fried Steak, huge plate of food that came with your choice of House Salad or Ceaser Salad. I dove into the mashed potatos, which upon their many options of how you want your potatos to taste (garlic, cheese, horshradish, etc), I picked garlic - always go safe at a first time resturaunt! The gravy was very bland, I ended up putting more salt on it. The potatos were the only thing salty and flavored on my plate. They had also put diced garlic in the mix, not roasted, but raw garlic. I love garlic, but I can't eat whole cloves (horrible headaches) like some of those awesome people can out there, so it was kinda a downer there. The two pieces of country fried steak was actually steak, but the very fatty piece of steak that you should never buy, cook, and serve.

Since I came with friends and family, it seemed the only thing they could put flavor in was the deep fried dishes. My mother ordered the Fish and Chips, they were slightly on the dark side, the fish wasn't fishy but slightly bland, the cocktail sauce was the only thing that saved the fish from being totally neglected lol. The fries were really good though! My friend had ordered the same thing, I think she wasn't complaining was because she had ordered mamosa's lol.

Service-wise, it was slow, but don't expect to be waited on asap on a dead Monday.

I think the only thing that tasted good was the Ice Cream Fudge Brownie, but that single dish alone won't help this review get to two stars.

All in all, eat at the other different eateries at Tempe Marketplace, I think Cadillac Ranch would be the last resort place if you can't get in to another popular resturaunt at the time."
1,"If you want a school that cares more about your financial aid money than you, this is the school for you. Education is horrible. If you are a democrat, don't speak your mind; you will be considered a reject from day one. I got 100% on my graduate papers and think I did not contribute anything to the fields. This institution is a joke."
1,"Most livable city my eye!
Plastic yuppies around every corner looking for a reason to belong.  I can't wait for the homosexuals to take control of this dog park and give it some class.

Avoid at all cost."
1,"in addition to sucking, it's also expensive."
1,"I just had a pretty unfortunate experience at Bison Witches in Tempe.  I remember liking this place when I went to ASU but not anymore!  It literally (no exaggeration) took 1.5 hours for our lunch, which was 3 people eating soups and sandwiches.  Our order took 45 minutes to arrive at our table (again, soup and sandwiches!), and several tables around us that had come in AFTER us, got food before us.  I normally am pretty easy going about stuff like this, but the server and a guy that appeared to be a manager/owner didn't even acknowledge the long wait time, no apology, nothing.  They weren't even that busy!  Our server barely even spoke to us when she came to the table, and acted like we were inconveniencing her.  I also saw her roll her eyes at another one of her tables as they got up to leave.  What kind of service is that!?  I wish I could say the food was any saving grace, but it wasn't.  Mediocre soup in a bread bowl, less than mediocre turkey on a bland sandwich.  I will NOT be going back, there's no point!  Save your time and money and hit up another one of the tasty places on Mill Ave.  Trust me, you'll be better off!"
1,sslowest drive through ever!!!
1,"What ever you do don't waste your money here.  I am not the person who likes to send food back, in fact I hate to do it.  I had no choice here, this was by far the worst mexican food I have eaten.  The food has such a horrible after taste.  I not only hated my meal but tried my boyfriends as well and it was still terrible.  The service compares to the food, we waited forvever just for a server to come over and greet us.  I wouldn't even recommend this place to my enemies."
1,Bad... food was horrible... do not waste your time or money
1,"Went last week, and ordered a dozen variety. I didn't care for any of them, very dry, the frosting wasn't very good,even my 9 yr old daughter spit her cupcake out!"
1,"If there was a way I could give this restaurant NO stars, I might have.  The chips and salsa are the ONLY thing that requires a star here.

The service was less than average, the food was hotter than the surface of the sun, and the drinks were teeny tiny (and didn't much taste like alcohol).  My husband ordered a green chile dish and it came smothered in red sauce, when he asked the waiter if it looked green or red, the server said, ""nope that's what green looks like"".  WOW!

Sorry but I don't think I will be returning."
1,"We went here for a family dinner.  Our family is loud and boisterous but not obnoxious.  We asked to be seated in the bar since some of us wanted to watch the game.  No problems so far.

Our waiter was really nice at first, but seemed flustered and as if he wasn't getting the help he needed to keep up with his tables.  I waited tables for 12 years and this guy was nearly literally scrambling to keep up, a sure sign of not enough help or lack of teamwork.  Of the two hostesses, ONE of them could have bothered to help him out by refilling water, tea and soda for us, but alas they did nothing.  We waited so long for drink refills that my husband got up and saw a pitcher of coke on the bar, so he poured himself a glass, which he was scolded for!  I could not believe it, I was shocked.  A guest should NEVER be treated this way.  If anything, someone should have apologized to my husband for not giving us what we needed for the meal. 

The chips were good, and they kept them coming, so props to them for that.  They are served with bean dip and salsa.  I liked the salsa a lot, not spicy enough for me, but a good amount and mixture of yummy stuff, including cilantro which I find many ""salsas"" don't even contain!  To me, it is not salsa without cilantro.  The teensy bowls of salsa they bring though need some rethinking.  They should either bring one per person or consider a bigger size.  It's only about 2 Tablespoons, and that aint much salsa (beware, some sides of rice and beans also come in these super tiny containers - three or four bites and it's gone)!  Anyhow, we ate tons of chips and salsa because the food took SO long to come out.  Our waiter sort of apologized for this by keeping us updated that it was actually coming.....someday.

Our food came out a good 35-40 minutes after we ordered.  Sadly, two meals were completely missing in action and the two of us that ordered fajitas (which came out of the kitchen very cool, not even the slightest bit of heat from the iron skillet or the meat) had to wait at least 10 minutes for their tortillas, so they couldn't even eat what was at the table, which was getting cold.  After the two missing meals came out, one was the wrong meat, red meat instead of chicken.  More waiting...the table eats, minus one.  When everyone is nearly finished, the right chicken taco dish comes out.  It was delicious, but overpriced.  The chicken was nicely grilled and the tacos were served the way I like them, with a little bit of onions, more cilantro, lettuce, lime and pico de gallo.  They also came with cheese, but I don't like cheese on tacos.  They came on tiny little corn tortillas, which themselves were good, but way too small to make decent tacos that didn't fall apart.  Plus, I ran out of  the tortillas before my meat and other stuff was gone.

Our waiter was really nice except for the scolding (I'm still floored by that), so I can't decide if he sucked or the place sucks, or maybe they both do...We definately won't be back."
1,"The parking is my beef with this place.  Why does a customer have to pay $12 for each time we park at the garage?  If you move in and out three times, that's $36 for parking.  Yes, my company was paying, but this was just outright stupid and I wouldn't make my company pay for this again.
I've been to Phoenix twice since then, and I've avoided this place and stayed at the Marriot.  Much better place."
1,"This place is the white-trash Chipotle. The food is mediocre at best. I mean seriously, how can you just up and steal Chipotle's idea! There's no creativity there. The Habenaro Salsa is flavorless and not hot at all. Seriously? I asked for HOT, not some yellowish tomato concoction for the people who can't handle real salsa!  At least Chipotle has hot salsa (not too hot either but much better) for a fast Americanized mexican food. Of course I much rather have the real deal but I do like Chiptole for what it is. Not this crap that Qdoba tries to serve up. 
The chicken is over seasoned and highly spiced/herbed you can barely taste the chicken. The Fajita veggie were the same. The product looked of very low quality. Oxidizing Guacamole and Lettuce. The meat looked unappetizing as well. Just not at the level of Chipotle. Although I have been here twice, this is the last time for me. I have been to one in Denver and for some reason thought it was better. So maybe it's management but I can say the food is less than good. I much rather go to Chiptole than this wannabe! Employees were dumber than a bag of Frijoles!
This place has the worst ""Mexican"" Food I have ever had next to a pre made burrito from 7-11 or a burrito from Taco Bell. Just disgusting food."
1,"Pure Fitness as a whole I like. No contracts, the people going there are actually there to work out and not to be seen, (ex. LA Fitness). Plus you get complimentary training sessions. However, this location I will NEVER return to and its all because of their new GM Adam. I had a free pass and he was the one that I had been assigned to for my fitness test and 1st training session. I had already explained that I planned to join but he wouldn't stop the full court press of selling which I didnt like at all. I wanted to use my weeks free pass THEN join. He wanted me to give him money right then and there when he hadnt so much as given me a tour yet! Anyway, I told him I wanted to wait and then he starts asking when I get paid, is it a money situation, etc..if made me VERY uncomfortable.

 I went ahead with the training session and he knew in advance that Im not inactive but going to the gym is not something Ive done on a consistent basis in a very long time. Now I enjoyed the workout but from what others have told me..he pushed me way to hard for my first time out of the gate. My arms weren't sore, I know sore, Im okay with sore but they became weak for FIVE days, that I had trouble sleeping they had that irritable and restless feeling, and it hurt to use a freakin' date stamp at work! 

But the reason Im not going back..I was surfing them online and saw how easy it was to sign up online so I did. That way I wouldnt have to worry about remembering voided checks etc.  Well I called Adam to let him know and he went off on me.. just short of yelling. ""Great, now I lose the commission the gym loses the points.. you can understand why Im upset right."" and he went on for about 5 minutes. I was stunned at how unprofessional he was and he's the GM??? If they work on commission they should give you a heads up ""hey I know its easy to sign up online but we work on commission so I would appreciate it if you went through me if and when you choose to sign up"". I would have respected that. OR if when you sign up online it allows you to put in the name of the person you have been working with so it doesn't circumvent them. But I was floored and pissed that he came at me like that. 

Ps. Of all the Pure Fitness this one is the smallest, visually unappealing and has the worst customer service. I did sign up and I love the one I go to now...but this one I will never step foot in again"
1,"Thank you to Sarah L for bringing to my attention that the lunch menu from which I got my information about the $34 crab cake entree was for the NYC location. However, I did note that the crab cake appetizer at the Scottsdale location  - presumably a smaller portion than the lunch entree - is $16. Yes, yes. It is Barney's and I understand the premium pricing. What I question is how Fred's scored only $$. I often eat out with those on a tighter foodie budget than mine; the $$ is misleading, when Oregano's is also $$. Just sayin'."
1,"I have always been a fan of Burlington's deals, however I will not be shopping at this one again. I went to return a belt... pretty simple. Instead, I stood in the customer service line for 15 minutes thanks to an employee of Burlington buying/putting things on layaway. It took three other staff to help her out. There were no words said to me except ""Hold on"". I was pissed. When the lady was finally done, the employee at the service asked ""what do you want?"" Serious help is needed there!
 If you work in the area of ""customer service"" I think you should have some."
1,They have some rude employees its unbelievable. I'm trying to give business to them and ordered 6 smoothies and the cashier and her employee gave me a dirty look. Not customer friendly. At all.
1,"I used to always go here for tires until my mechanic noticed my tires were the incorrect size.  Back to Discount I go to correct the problem, and they blamed me. I was told that I must have chosen the smaller tires to save 20 bucks a tire.  I ended up having to spend a lot of money on five new tires (my spare is a full size as well) three weeks before Christmas. I wrote the company a letter to tell them how wrong I felt the entire experience was, and I never heard anything back.  I will not be going here for future tire needs."
1,"Bitzee Mama's isn't my mama! My mama wouldn't have kept her hungry son waiting forever for his lunch. She wouldn't have let my go thirsty with no refills. She does make a good bowl of salsa so that makes it alright, right? 

Took my real mama there for lunch.. I ordered the taco salad and ma ordered the cheese enchilada plate.. also a bowl or red chile. Taco salad was alright except the taco shell was so mushy from water it literally fell apart when I picked it up.. glad I wasn't eating the shell. She's old school.. makes a darn good cheese enchilada and refried beans. Struck out again with the red chile.. I swear, can no one except La Canasta make red chile? While the meat was tender and the sauce was smooth it had a weird orange color to it and the meat tasted, well wasn't any beef Ive ever had. 

On the way to the counter to pay my bill I noticed that almost everyone was eating chimichanga's.. well then, looks like I ordered the wrong thing! Place is also uber cheap. 

Be careful what you order and mama will be just fine."
1,Filthy place.  Bad tasteless food.  Rude waitress.  Yuck!!!!
1,"Every time I come here the staff is so rude! Its the closest bar to my gate so I'm kinda stuck. Hey staff, can you please pretend to like people????"
1,"Terrible experience here. They cut up my foot when trying to remove a callus. Also, they told me they used shellac when it was really gelish. Wish I could recommend, but I wouldn't want anyone else to go through the same experience."
1,Will never eat here again. Sandwich was meteocre and overpriced. On top Of that I was charged more than I was told the total was. Horrible first time experience!
1,"eeew. It started with a cranky waiter who told me that if I wanted to know the specials, then I should have read them on the board. The food was downhill from there. The entire place smelled like fried onions."
1,"Sadly, I have to join the crowd on this one. I was hoping that Kitchen 56 would make my memories of Vatra go away, but instead just reminded me all over again. Food was WAY overpriced and just OK. Kudos to Eddie the Server who brought with him the only charm available the second time we tried K56; I'd give him 4 stars if the review were based solely on his service & personality. I will say the interior is much better than the previous incarnation, but the spots (lights) at the counter-height 4 top shone in my eyes and made me feel like it was last call...and I don't drink."
1,"Should be called The Bad Egg. Bottom line, the hotel's free breakfast tasted better than this and we got better service there. 

We arrived around 945am on a Sunday morning and had to wait around seven minutes to be seated. The staff was pleasant enough. We were seated, given menus with water and she took our order for coffee and the breakfast special (loaded potato skillet). We sat for 15 minutes before we saw our waitress again. She finally figured out she forgot to bring our coffee. We finally got some coffee which was mediocre in flavor. Our food arrived about ten minutes after that. The skillet was supposed to contain sausage, bacon, onion, scrambled eggs, grilled american potatoes covered with cheese and sour cream. Mine had no bacon, two tiny chunks of sausage, no cheese, and the potatoes were so soggy, they tasted like someone had thawed them and thrown them in as an afterthought. It was so unpalatable i could not eat more than one bite, even after loading it up with salt and hot sauce. The waitress never checked on us once during the meal. She came back by the time my husband was finished. I told her the meal was horrible (in a nice way). She offered me something else. By that point, I was not feeling like eating anything else, I felt kinda sick. My meal was comped and we did get an apology. The manager explained that everyone LOVES that special and the potatoes are seasoned and grilled. The cook obviously didn't try my potatoes. Blech. Even with the comp, the total was over $15 for one special and two coffees. Very hight priced for nasty food, poor service, and loud/uninspiring atmosphere."
1,"This place needs to close their doors, get their act together, and then reopen. The atmosphere is boring and it is obvious that they did the bare minimum coverup from the last restaurant. The food is horribly boring and has no flavor. I ordered the chicken and avocado pizza and it literally tasted like nothing! We also got the nachos (which was actually just a plate of chips with one tiny pinch of cheese and soggy beef). In addition, the server didn't put in my order for my pizza, hardly apologized and then brought it to me 30 minutes after my friends were done eating. One of my friends ordered the ahi tuna and it was switched with someone else's special order so that had to go back to the kitchen and be reordered as well. The only thing I liked was the beer, and that too took forever and I had to remind my server several times to get me a refill. Way to much effort to get food and drink that is sub par at best."
1,"Some of my friends brought me here last night and the first thing that came into my mind was that this was a set up for To Catch A Predator. I was ready for Chris Hansen to pop out and grill me with, ""What are you doing here?"" If you feel like Kubrick's Lolita really speaks to you, as in it mirrors your life, then you've found a place to feel comfortable in your pervert skin.

If you're of age to consume alcohol, they've got a bar here. The thing about this bar though is that they're really sloppy about pouring drinks, ie. a Manhattan should not taste like a barber's cleaning solution. The decor and set up of this place really needs a face lift.

A few pluses though... If you're under 21, I could see how this would be appealing. I'll admit that the under-21 clubs that I went to when I was under 21 were fun, but now that I think about them they really suck. It seems like an alright experience if this is your first step into the club/bar world. The DJ's here spin pretty much straight hip-hop which is fine, it's very mainstream though and nasty bumping music.

If you go here you're one of three types of people:

1) You were dragged here by your friends
2) You're under 21
or, 3) Your usual excuse is a heart-felt plea, complete with waterworks, that goes something along the lines of, ""I swear, Officer, I thought she was 18!!!!"""
1,"As you walk in you are greeted by a sign that says Cash Only ATM inside alright times are tough I get it.  Then you see the special board which read ""Good Food Takes Time"" and there is a clock next to that.  Fine that's cool but the problem is that after waiting for our ""good food"" it came out and was awful.  My wife said she has tasted better pancakes out of the freezer section at the grocery store.  $30 later we boxed up the food only to throw it away.  The good news is that we went around the corner to the Breakfast Club and had an excellent meal."
1,"Warning: Douche Bag level CODE RED!

Here's how my experience went ... 

Me: ""May I have a Carmel Latte?"" 
Employee: ""No""
.... dead air ...
Me: ""Ummm why not?""
Employee: ""We don't have carmel""
Me: ""Ummm I guess I'll just have a Cappuccino then""
Employee: ""Just so you know it's a REAL Cappuccino""
Me: ""Okay"" (in my head I'm trying to figure out if I can legally punch this dickhead in the face or not).

So I sat down mulling over this experience in the dank dark atmosphere while listening to this ass wipe talk to his friend about living on other peoples couches for the past few months and about how he'll be moving to downtown Phoenix soon. To which I just chuckled to myself as this person was FAR from cool enough to blend into CenPho. What a complete and utter douche bag. Stay in Tempe poser (and keep your employer there to!).

This experience was months ago, and now they have opened up a shop downtown. Guess what? I'm not going to check them out. Fuck you Cartel. You'll never be Lux, so just stay in Tempe where you can be a complete poser with an attitude that you haven't earned.

Complete FAIL. 

For my two cents, skip this place and go to Lux in CenPho/Mid Town right off the Light Rail. Authentically cool with ZERO attitude, great coffee and no douche bag employees. 

And as for great coffee ... try Conspire WAY better coffee and authenticly cool.

---- 
please read ""owners comment"" below ... here's my response ... 
----
Wow so the coffee snobbery continues with the owner ... I guess my new job  should be to ""promote good coffee in Arizona"" ... and I don't appreciate good coffee because I enjoy the combination of caramel AND coffee ... 

By that definition I guess I don't know good ice cream because I like hot fudge on it or good pizza because I enjoy pepperoni AND cheese or good music if it's not acoustic or a good voice unless it's A cappella ... thanks for proving my point. I wouldn't go here unless you are a total coffee snob ... (I guess) they don't need your business you poser!"
1,"Surprised this place isn't closed by now. Went here once when I first started going to ASU and never came back.

Their ingredients are not fresh, gyro meat tastes old and decrepit. They really need to hire better pita makers who don't resemble drug addicts and derelicts. My pita was falling apart before it was even handed to me. Literally, by the time I got it to the table it was soggy and not even worth eating!"
1,"10:30pm on a Saturday night.  My friend and I try our second attempt at sushi for the night (see my review of Pearl for the first).  Place is hopping.  We take a seat at the sushi bar.

The Waitress:  ""Are you girls going to be ordering sushi?""
Me: I have a sushi menu in my hand, ""yes.""
Waitress:  ""Would you mind putting it in soon because they want to go home too.""
Me: What the fuck, bitch. ""Uh, ok""

Dear Ra Waitress,

I'm sorry if I kept you or any other employess, especially since I finished eating my roll before your kitchen even closed.  It was completely ok to rush me, even though I had no intention of staying all fucking night and even though plenty of new sushi orders came after mine.  I was hardly the last customer in there.  There were people all around me ordering sushi, so I'm still unclear as to why you needed to rush me.  If you were in such a hurry- why did it take you longer to bring and process my bill than it did for me to eat your food?  Maybe it was because you don't know how to count, since you gave the wrong amount of change and I ended up having to tell you the correct amount since you couldn't count it on the spot.  I like Ra for the atmosphere, something you completely ruined.  Thanks for that.   

Sincerely,
Morgan"
1,"After reading all the good reviews, we were looking forward to eating here, but we were a bit apprehensive due to the couple of bad reviews because of the smell. Bummer...the smell just killed it for us right from the get go. Immediately, upon walking in the door, the pungent smell of backed up sewer hit us like a ton-of-bricks. We did a 180 and walked right out. No way I could sit through a meal here while breathing that funk. 

Get the smell worked out and we will give you another shot, Tasty Thai."
1,"AWFUL!!! HORRIBLE!!!!!
IT was just HORRIBLE experience! 

I made an appointment for mani and pedi and came in Friday morning at 10 am. There was only one lady working there (no bage with her name) She said she could take me earlier than 10. I said it's fine, she asked me  to pay cash right away! only cash she said!! And ask me to go to ATM to get cash! I was surprised, but didn;t think anything bad. Later I realized that I didnt get any reciept so she just put my cash in her pocket because there were noone else there at that time.

She started with manicure and it took her less than 10 min!! everything was done in 10 min! She didnt even the nails, didnt remove the cuticule -she just polished the nailes with an old file. Her work was so nigligent in everything! Nail polish was all around the nails and my finger tips. I suggested her to correct it and remove an extra polish around and she did it only on few nails, repeating all the time :""Pretty? Yes?"" It was so far from looking pretty!

I'm a polite person by nature and never argue, but here it was just awful! And I payed her first together with the tips so she took 45 bucks from me

Her pedi was not better at all!! She was always in a hurry! She didnt let my nails  dry and started putting my shoes on me! I warned her that it must have been not done yet, but she didnt listen, she wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible, so all the nails went messy!!! She reapplied the polish but the whole procedure was just so frustrating!! I left the place more than just upset-I was really mad!  

The next day the nail polish started to chip off on every other finger! OMG! I wanted to cry! It's the worse mani and pedi I've ever gotten in my entire life, and I do it every month!!


I wish I had a reciept and could get back to talk to the manager -but this lady just took my 45 bucks and left me with ugly! really ugly work!!!"
1,"This is one of the franchise store of Ritz Camera in Chandler. The store's staffs are nice, however, their photo lab is miss leading. They make the price in very small fonts and hanging on the ceiling. 

For the first time user to print photos in the lab, I was charged for $45 for just few 4x6 and 8x10 print without sign-in as member. I asked for canceling order prior they print the photos. I was told ""Too late"" even it's still in one of their store pc for ordering prints. 

Since they are franchise, I should be able to return or exchange the accessories I bought for my Nikon D70S camera in different store. I was told ""No"". I can only exchange or return to the stores I purchase them. 

I will not buy anything from them again."
1,Good service but the food was horrific. The pollo fundido was dry & no flavor.  Could not eat the tamale it was so bad. Will not go back. I had better Mexican off the neighborhood roach coach.
1,"An upscale mexican restaurant in the area seemed like the best thing to have happened to me. I planned my visit for a quieter evening, and reviewed the menu again and again. 

However, upon our arrival I thought twice immediately. The parking was iffy, and the place didn't seem to stand up to the signage. Perhaps the art was not to my liking, honestly not a piece stands out in my memory. 


We were seated immediately. 

Our waiter seemed a little off, not to mention the fact that he was insanely snobby and seemed to be moonlighting in the kitchen, where he disappeared for 10-15 minutes at a time. He did not fill our soft drinks once without being first flagged down (those of you who have experienced the close quarters will understand how ridiculous this is). 

Halfway through waiting for our food (which took 45 minutes, easily), the lamp above our table went out. We sat in the dark for a good 5 minutes before they even noticed. Which was actually a nice change of scenery from the boring beige walls. 

When the food finally arrived, we were too tired (due to having finished an entire bottle of wine) so we left. Unfortunately, we took our grub with us.
I had some sort of mixed seafood entree with chorizo and a creamy sauce. It's no coincidence you're taken aback by the combination... it didn't go down too easily. Having dropped 90 dollars on the meal, though, we felt compelled to finish as much as we could stand. 

Normally I would make sure I got the name of the dish right, but since I am recommending that you not go there, why bother?"
1,"I can't even believe I actually went to this restaurant.  My feeling was that if the Tommy Bahama clothing and its wearers were any indication of the dining experience, it was going to be unoriginal and in poor taste.  Alas my friend wanted to go there was his birthday lunch so....  Let me be clear that I'm not a food snob at all.  Just last week I enjoyed a lunch of Nachos Bell Grande and a bean and cheese burrito at Taco Bell very, very much.  That was far superior to this lunch at Tommy Bahama. 

The decor was comfortable and breezy.  Everything else  - not so much.  1st it's nice that they bring you bread and butter, but a sweetly flavored butter?  Why mess with the pure goodness of butter?  The glass of lemonade I ordered was sickeningly sweet, and I am a notorious for my sweet tooth.  It was undrinkable until I cut it with water.  The coconut shrimp also had an overly sweet sauce.  So much so that we could each only eat 1 of 6 shrimp.  I got the crab bisque which was crazy salty, and in my opinion, contained previously frozen hence rubbery crab meat.  

As it was my friend's birthday, they brought him a complimentary dessert.  Very nice. He got the newest one which was some sort of chocolate/caramel-filled cake with oreo crust, chocolate mousse topping, sprinkled with crushed Heath bar.  Sounds good, right?  Vile, absolutely vile.  Overly sweet except for the oreo crust that was saturated in butter.  On an update note - it was not the nasty sweet butter they serve with the bread though.    

My final issue was with our young, highly attentive server.  He was very sweet and well-intentioned.  However I feel that every server in the world needs to stop speaking to customers in the collective.  Don't say ""are we enjoying our coconut shrimp?"" or ""are we ready for dessert?""  Unless I've badly misinterpreted our relationship, ""we"" aren't doing anything together. Just a pet peeve -  I still tipped him 22% and kept my mouth shut about this odd little quirk.  

oh and the bill for coconut shrimp appy, quesadilla, cup of crab bisque, lemonade and glass of white wine?  $52.  for lunch.  

Tommy Bahama and I just didn't work out at all."
1,This place is disgusting!!  The bun was dry and stale.  The veggie burger was yucky... I don't think I have ever had one I didn't like before.  The kids meals are miniscule.  The topping bar is so simple and plain.  The dips are not very good... cheese dip is YUCK!  Drink choices stink.  Cookies taste raw and boring.  Almost forgot to add that the two young kids didn't even care for the french fries because they are seasoned.  I thought they were a total waste of calories.  I can't believe the prices either... so not cheap or even worth what you pay for.
1,"My significant other had a $25 off coupon from Restaurant.com LOL. That could sum up the whole trip. I haven't been to many restaurants that participate with restaurant.com that are decent at all. I mean, I wasn't expecting much coming into this place, I shouldn't have expected anything here.

I was in the mood for some red meat, and sushi places do actually have decent dishes like teriyaki chicken and stuff like that sometimes. So, I didn't mind checking this place out since I do like a little bit of sushi on the side. The boolgogee, plain, simply plain. There was a salad with the boolgogee, but it too was plain. There wasn't nearly enough meat to warrant a price tag of $8, because the salad and rice probably didn't cost more than $0.50 to make.

Oh, the sushi? All of the sushi we happened to get were either super plain or super spicy. By spicy, I mean that there were just too many tastes going on at the same time and it was too overwhelming. I tried a few bites of the 3-4 different rolls we got. After I tried each roll I thought that I liked it but that the taste was too overwhelming for me to want to try another bite. We paid $18 for the food even after the coupon, and I honestly think that even at the price it might be a bit of a rip off considering you can get cheaper, higher quality sushi at Teharu.

This place is a rip-off for sushi in my opinion. Its not good enough to warrant the hefty price tag. The sad part is that the interior is very well done, if the food was actually good this place would be extremely interesting."
1,Pop the Soda Shop has closed its doors last month.
1,Worst enchiladas EVER and decor from a 1980's attempt at a mexican restaurant.  Taco Bell is a step up!  But if you like soupy enchiladas drowning in cheez wiz this is the place for you.
1,"May have great food but I'll never know. Ordered delivery and the chef who doesn't speak English couldn't find my apartment complex even when I walked out to the street right next to the 101 far away. He said he was there but couldn't tell me where he was. Talked to him on the phone for ten minutes then hung up on me when I guess he got frustrated and wouldn't answer my calls back. Called to order food for my visiting family and was glad to find this place but that chef is awful. The owner apologized to me profusely and that was a nice gesture but waiting an hour for a guy who hangs up on you and can't find a place looking at the 101 exit is ridiculous. Don't use them for delivery ever, call the Breakfast Joynt. Their owner is awesome and delivers to you himself. Plus, he actually knows the area. Cannot express my frustration with this restaurant's service. Do not use EVER"
1,"Found the doctor via his website and called for an appointment. The ladies that answer the phone are sweet so I felt I made a good choice. I was taken into the room and a sweet girl asked me questions and told me the doctor would be right in. He came in quickly and asked if I would mind if someone that was following him would be present. Fine. The other guy walked in along with a lady (medical assistant maybe). No one introduced either of them. Dr. Racette didn't ask me one question and didn't address any of my concerns. He seemed to even brush off the questions I asked or responded with brusqueness. It was very irritating as a patient to be asking questions about serious topics like skin cancer and feel blown off. He prescribed a cream for me and was walking out the door minutes after seeing me and said he would have someone come in with the script. He never talked to me about how the cream works or what it does. Awful awful. Too top it off, they were supposed to call me with test results. I had to call them and the gal that answered said, ""no one called you with the results yet?: NO!! Will not see this doctor again. Sorry but I actually prefer doctors that care to take the time and actually address my questions and make me feel comfortable, not take 5 minutes to rush me through an appointment."
1,I work right across the street and a few of us went here for lunch one afternoon. I ordered a salad to go. As soon as I saw the guy grab shredded sandwich lettuce to make my salad I almost told him to stop but I didn't. I regreted it when I started to dig in and realized the lettuce was brown and yellow. Very disappointed. $6+ bucks for nasty lettuce tomatoes and green peppers. I ordered a salad thinking I was getting something like the picture on their website. I won't be returning here. I'll be passing on lunch next time the co-workers opt for this place.
1,"I dont understand how a second restaurant was opened on Tatum . My husband and gave these place too many chances and wach time the food was not impressive. The margaritas come from a stolen recipe from La Pinata Nueva , but too bad they didnt bring the recipes with them. I hope they get it "" that maybe if you put alittle quality in the food people will come back""."
1,"There were 3 cars in the parking lot and people walking to the door but the young lady closed the doors at 9:51pm

The young lady spoke through the glass for atleast 4 minutes explaining she would not open the doors

I live behind this location but I may not return. There is a Walgreens off of 7th Street..."
1,"Normally have had great service & food here, but on Father's Day, Nicole H was simply horrible.  Rude, slow, non-helpful, etc.  Just a total fail.  

A different food-deliverer brought out food and ""auctioned it off"" (didn't know who got what), and I asked for a refill on my empty water glass, but he didn't bring it after 15 minutes, and Nicole didn't notice, so I had to bring it up to her.

Their bloody Mary's taste just like tomato juice with tobasco.  Nothing special at all.  And for $12???!?!?!??!?!  SHAME.

The coq au vin was great.

WHY IS THERE NO ""CONTACT US""/e-mail address ON THEIR WEBSITE?????"
1,"I got a BBQ chicken sandwich and all the bones came complementary! SICK!  I almost broke my teeth when I bit into it.  The service was even worse, the manager (I think) stood in the way of me ordering while he was talking on the phone about football for about 10 min.GROSS!"
1,"I'll start with the positive.  They have some friendly members of staff.  That's it.  You might catch a staff infection here, so watch out.  It's like a shack that somehow got a bar licence.  I have a friend who drags me here on occasion as it's his favourite dive.  It's one wrong glance away from a fight, every time.  If you like the danger and excitement of drinking a beer in a building that may collapse on you, go for it.  If not, avoid the dregs of society and go somewhere else."
1,"Not busy at all but took nearly 45 min to get our meal.  Ordered the trout and was shocked to see lots and lots of bones. Hmmmmm. Well asked the waitress about it and she said ""they try the best they can""  hmmmmmm isn't this a ""fish"" restaurant? 
They comped the trout but still not sure I would go back."
1,"Pho-yuck this place! 

I was tricked in to going here with promises of great Vietnamese. I was ready for a culinary adventure and what I got was a ride in the fright house. 

The Bánh xèo was so greasy I couldn't eat it, it was literally served on a plate of grease. 

The bun was about the same. It lacked flavor, the rice noodles were slimy, the spring roll was loaded with grease. 

I ordered some sort of plum soda drink and it had a cup of salt on the bottom of the glass.

The service was horrible and I will not be back."
1,"Was in town for a business meeting and tried to catch a movie with a friend. First impression of the place was that it needed a total make over.  I mean TOTAL MAKEOVER. Walked up to buy my ticket, and the lady was a total jerk! She had no idea when the movie times were, and she clearly thought we were stupid. She messed up our change, and didn't believe us when we told her. When we walked in they ripped the tickets out of our hands.  When it came time to order our food, the butter on the popcorn tasted like cough syrup. The theater was extremely dirty, and kids were screaming throughout the movie.  After the movie I politely told the manager about our horrible experience.  He was not understanding at all and even threatened to kick us out. I was appaled by this whole endeavor and that is why I am writing this review. It was a complete waste of time and money and I recommend everyone to stay away."
1,"There are few resources in Arizona for dancers, actors and performers, so it's best to order online if you have the time to wait for shipping. Dee's Dancewear is overpriced and because they know they are the only game in town, their customer service (and return policies) have suffered.
In an emergency situation, you're better suited going to Mischa's Dancewear on 33rd Ave and Bell or Capezio's in Scottsdale. Otherwise, order online and steer clear of this establishment when possible."
1,"I've eaten here many times, but none as bad as last night.
Service was excellent, and highly attentive.
Food, absolutely horrible.

My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye. 
What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered. 
What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style. 
Salad, similar to something you could get at Chick Filet
Veggies, blah.
Bread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh. 

In addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English. 

I've had it with this place.
If I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner, it'll be at Mortons, or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/2 in thick, cooked to perfection, and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle"
1,Got a padi and the tech stopped for a while to eat. then i got a new tech to finish my pedi. my total was different than the quoted price. when paying my total was $25 i hanede them a $50 and they cashier tried to keep all the change for a tip. he refused to give me my change until i told him that is not gon to happen.

1,"Just a quick update - this KFC shut down just a few weeks ago. 

There still might be someone in line tho..."
1,This location is now closed.
1,"2nd time messing up our carry out order. Boneless wings have bones and no carrots or celery again!!  Hamburger with only tomato, cheese, and BBQ sauce had onions and lettuce, when we specifically said no lettuce or onion. Allergic to onions and don't like shredded lettuce. Thanks to Tiler for messing up our order again. Will not be back."
1,"This address is for the one next to Panda Express, not the one in Walmart.

This place sucks and it doesnt even come close to any other McDonalds. How in the world can you have so many employees working and have a line of people waiting for their food? It's like there is retarded people working there and they all have special needs. This one guys was just waiting for a happy meal and had been waiting for 10 minutes before I even got there. It them about 15 minutes for them to give me my food. One mexican kid that was working was to busy flirting with this girl in front of everyone, while her father was asking why the food was taking so long to make. 

The dining area was dirty after I got my food and sat down. They should fire the manager and everyone that works there. They take no pride in working there and its sad to see this. It shouldnt matter what they are being paid to be there, its still a job and they ARE being paid to be there. 

I will NOT be returning to this place......."
1,I don't get it. This place is crazy busy with no Manager in sight and in hiding during the busy dinner hour. No name tags on the employees. I was scolded for pointing over the sneeze glass to the sauce that I wanted since nothing was labeled. I guess I violated the health code. Thanks for not locking me up. I told my family we will not spend one more dime here.
1,"Lazy Q CLOSED in 2010.  New Owners cleaned up the place and its called JESTERS BILLIARDS.  Tons of beer, AC smoking patio with pool tables.  Re-did tables and got new cues.  Its rockin now."
1,"There was hair in the food. Not just 1 but 2 in the same Bhel Puri dish.

The whole experience was pretty bad. There is no indication of how you order your food and when you finally figure it out the food does not taste good. We checked sodas on the order sheet and when no sodas showed up we asked if we were supposed to go and find our own sodas from the front of the store and were told that that was the case.

Also the guy at the counter is down right dismissive.

Pani Puri was OK
Papdi Chaat - boring, no flavor
Bhel Puri - boring and no flavor before we found the hairs

Not worth the trip."
1,"This may be my worst dining experience ever.

The scenery was beautiful, we can't complain about that. The menu was decent, there was a good number of selections to choose from. However the prices were definitely high, we're just talking tacos & burritos here...

I ordered a taco salad with steak. It was $11.99, for lunch...which I thought was crazy.  When I got the salad, it was the cheap iceberg lettuce, with a couple tomatoes & a few onions. The steak was DISCUSTING. I wouldn't feed a dog that steak meat. I asked the waiter for some salad dressing, he gave me this funny look and said ""most people just use salsa, but I guess I can get you some ranch or something"". Great service, huh? I asked the waiter about the margarittas, and he willingfully told me that the 3 cheapest ones are no good and are too watered down. Nice...so I then asked about the Patron Margaritta (my fav tequilla). The Patron rita was $16!!! 

The waiter was extremely unprofessional, and even gave us this pitch about how he's only working there until he finds a new ""gig"". The prices were ridiculous! I would NEVER go there again and hope to share my story with many people before they waste their money!!"
1,"This place is a dump. I'm a widow, and I have a long-term chronic condition, still, they allowed their tenant to pick on me, throw a bottle at me, then their maintenance person told me the lock was never changed, They did not paint, but lied and said they did. It's totally drug-infested, They don't keep their word.  I would skip it."
1,"The food is simple, pure and uncomplicated; you taste (and hopefully enjoy) each ingredient. However, as with most minimally processed cooked foods, it does not travel well.  So, eat in. Luckily the decor is modern and compliments the menu well which makes eating in a pleasure.   

My only down note is on the service. If you are not careful when you enter the restaurant, you may enter through the door of invisibility and will become invisible to the employees. As a result, you may stand at the counter while they work around you but do not recognize your presence until the invisibility dust (or whatever makes you invisible) wears off.  Based upon my late lunch experience today, the dust takes 4 iPhone e-mail responses or texts to be removed (10ish minutes). Regrettably, I only had three unanswered e-mails in my inbox and had to leave before I could be seen by the employees. On a positive note, when you leave (regardless of the time you waited), the invisibility dust seems to be removed. I know this as no one honked or screamed at my car as it drove away without a driver."
1,"They added broasted chicken to their menu... I love me some broasted chicken, so in I went to investigate.

I do not love me THEIR broasted chicken.

To me it tasted rubbery and had a strange odor, and it was so salty that an hour later I could still taste it. I ordered a few pieces and I ate part of one and then bolted.

I can't speak to anything else on the menu. Their garlic knots, for what it's worth, were fine."
1,"This review is based solely on service - not the food. 

I am sitting in a booth at RA as I type this - that is how upset I am with the host staff at ra. I called ahead to inform the restaurant that we would have a party of 8. When we arrived the girls at the front were so rude I almost walked out. We waited 35 min for our table and the entire time the host staff was looking my entire group up and down giving us the ""stink eye"". I am sorry that you are 18 years old, work for $8 and have a stick up your butt, but do not make us feel unwelcome. My girlfriend and I went to the back to use the bathroom - the host followed us back and asked us what we were doing - not to help us find the bathroom but just to be a snob. From here on out ra is ruined for me."
1,I have literally never seen this place open and I live two blocks away.
1,"Staff is nice, and that's it.
They use very cheap tires that only last for a year."
1,"My family and I ate here just a few days ago. It was an experience that left me yearning for more out of a restaurant I have seen so crowded over the years and decided to try with a group of 7 of us in the family. First off we got there at 10 am and were missing only two in our party so we had to wait to be seated which was fine. Once the rest of our party showed up at 10:07 we were not seated until after 10:30. When we were seated we were all scrunched together at a medium sized table that would comfortable seat 5 adults. Well, there were 7 of us total and needless to say it was very tight! The waitress stated that we could take our water and go wait back up front for a bigger table but we were looking at roughly 40 minutes of waiting again!!! Seriously? We ordered drinks first and the waitress brought my father his tomato juice and almost spilled it on him but instead spilled it all over her hand. Then she sat the glass down in front of him with juice on table and all over glass and left! She never came back with a wet towel to clean up her mess!! We all ordered and the food arrived quickly. This was the only part of the experience that was good, sadly to say. We received our food order for 7 of us within 15-20 minutes which was excellent. My uncle and grandmother both had charred toast (it was black, not just black around the edges) . The bacon looked like dried strips of hard leather. Overall, none of us will be returning to this place! It was is so overrated. We are headed back to RANDY'S here in Scottsdale to do our next family breakfast."
1,"For frozen yogurt quality, I give this place a one. Honestly, it's small, there's very little variety in terms of toppings, and the yogurt tastes cheap... Probably because it's a big franchise. There is a reason why you're paying less for an ounce... Truly - you get what you pay for. 
The concept is neat, sure, but if you're looking for pizzazz then you should try Yogurtini... It's just up the road from Yogurtland. Anyway, the single star says it all... ""Eek! Methinks not."""
1,"Einsteins in general has mediocre bagels at best, and their ""schmears"" appear to be highly processed.  I've generally given up on Einsteins all together because because their food has really taken a nose dive, as has the service.  I stopped by this location recently because I was driving by and in a hurry, and wanted a bagel (they're supposed be a bagel store after all!).  First, no salt bagels.  Aren't salt bagels one of the standards?  Second, I ordered my bagel with cream cheese (cream cheese being a $1.50 option) to go and that was my real mistake.  Whoever made the bagel didn't even manage to slice all the way through the bagel and put an amount of cream cheese approximately equivalent to a pat of butter on one-half of the bagel.  The other half was basically dry.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I was pretty annoyed when I got to work and opened up my bagel.  Stick to any of the local bagel joints like Chompies or Kashmans - they have much better bagels, and they will dump a brick of cream cheese on them for you."
1,"I have nothing more to add, but I don't want anyone to think 'only a few' people had  complaints about this poorly planned ""festival."" 

Oh, wait, I do. 

I was there with my 4 year old grand-daughter (and my daughter), since there were going to be kids attractions as well as the food trucks. I thought it was nuts that 3 minutes of jumping around cost $3. But I guess it was consistent with the $4 water and $7 beers.

And it would help if there was some roadway controls and/or temporary signage. By 11am, traffic backed up (down) Pima from the event to Indian Bend and over towards the 101. Cars were skipping ahead and cutting into line, further delaying entrance. 

If success is measured by interest, the festival was a success. If by performance and customer satisfaction, not so much. And how can a vendor commit to showing and not have enough food to feed the presold ticket holders? Why risk your hard-fought reputation?"
1,"My co-workers and I refer to this place as ""Pizza n' Ants"".  The staff will be happy to serve you with bare hands, right after using the till.  Also, as the nickname suggests, there has been a noticable insect problem. 



As if that could all be overlooked, the pizza isn't even good.  If you are in this part of town, go to Z Pizza or Slices for great pizza instead!"
1,"I would absolutely not recommend living here. I lived at these apartments for a year, and wow was the management staff a MESS. When I moved in, my mailbox was broken so I couldn't get mail for a week. They didn't give me a pool key, they gave me the wrong apartment keys, they would mix up all my information, and they just weren't very nice. I can't remember how many times they lost my work orders so I'd have to call and call to make sure things got fixed in my apartment! The neighbors were loud--I had to call the police maybe four times because they wouldn't turn down their music and I had to study for school and finals, and random people came banging on the door looking for some girl who had obviously p'd them off. The police came to my house in the middle of the night looking for her, too. One time, they gave my garage to somebody else even though I was still paying for it and when my husband came home in the evening with his pick-up full of expensive equipment, we had to wait for the cops to come and figure out whose car it was who was parked in our garage! it was a total nightmare. Shortly before I moved out new staff came in and they seemed somewhat better organized. But---I wouldn't take the chance. For the same price, you can definitely find somewhere better to live."
1,"The cheesy breadsticks were delicious.  Everything else, not so much."
1,"Overcrowded, sprawling mess of a mall (and I normally like malls). Traffic and parking are almost as bad as at Tempe Marketplace. The confusing layout makes it hard to find specific stores (even with the help of the directories)."
1,"really, I can't believe this place has received such high reviews from people.

my lady and i walked in, and were greeted rather rudely by a pretentious bitch at the front with a monotone ""name please?"", instead of a warm, friendly, french welcome to this rather charming looking place. we didn't have a reservation, which from the looks of how dead empty the place was, didn't seem like a problem. until the hostess whisked through her reservation list and explained she'd try to ""fit us in"". it was 6pm, the place had one other couple dining, and we were informed that the next party was arriving at 7:30. we weren't really looking to hang out. it would have be awfully lovely if yelpers would have informed of the need to MAKE RESERVATIONS before going in here, because if you don't, you're automatically a piece of shit according to the staff. sorry, i don't plan very much ahead. next time i will, and it won't be here.

anyways, after debating for a minute or two with herself, the hostess decided we could ""squeeze in"" and sat us right on top of the other couple inside the restaurant. she informed us that we could cork our own wine, for their low low price of 9 fucking dollars. in words only office space could adequately describe,""coup des tartes, what is it exactly that you do?"". 

the food was good, nothing spectacular for $25+ a plate. we got a salad with apples and nuts and bleu cheese, which was served warm. now this is the first warm salad i've had all of my life, and by no means am i some sort of wordly food expert, but i believe salad should be cold and crisp. not soggy and warm. yuck. the cordon bleu was tasty and filling, however, the wobbly table was an extreme annoyance when cutting through the chicken, but it was solved (with no thanks to the staff) by placing a jack-in-the-box gift card under the leg. i will admit, the mashed potatoes are some of the creamiest and best i've ever had. my lady got the pork tenderloin, which had a strange peppery-sweet pairing which i didn't particularly care for. we were broke for desert, so unfortunately we didn't get to try any tarts. you would think for a place that promotes itself as being so poise would get some fancier menus, other than a $.15 piece of cardstock copied in bulk at kinkos.

this place was rather disappointing. i honestly thought it would be way more comfy and welcoming inside but it really wasn't. it presents itself as being so high class and french and oh-la-la wee wee, but when it comes down to it, it's still located in a tiny shack of a house at 16th street and highland. maybe if it were located in the biltmore i'd give it a bit more cred."
1,"If you have to be some place on time, don't use them.  I called at 2pm for a 4:15 taxi to arrive.  At 4:25 they were calling me saying he was right around the corner, and gave me his location.  Estrella called a couple more times to ""verify my address"".  At 4:35 I called them and cancelled the cab and got a ride from my neighbor.  As we pulled out of my neighborhood, we PASSED the cab. He had taken a street that he thought was going to be a through street and got himself lost. This is a TAXI service, they should know how to get around the valley!!  Don't these people use GPS, or MAPS at least?!?!?!?  End of story, I was still late for my class that I paid 250.00 bucks for. I was not allowed in, and the money is non refundable.  So thanks Estrella wasting my time and costing me money.  WORST TAXI SERVICE EVER."
1,"We decided to hit up the ""Wine Down Wednesday"" that was happenin' at Tastings courtesy of KYOT.  Here's what went wrong:

The event is from 6-8 so we arrived just a few minutes (3 maybe?) after 6 so we could get a spot just in case it was hoppin'.  We walked in and the hostess (she looks like she's possibly the manager or owner) asked if we were there for the event and then pointed us towards the back room where the event was being held.

We walked in and there were about 7 tables and there were people at them all already.  Talk about early bird gets the worm!  We had to wait for about 3-4 minutes for the waitress to finish with a table to find out if we could sit on the patio for the event.  She said yes and that she would be right out to help us.  In the meantime another woman and her friend also took up at a patio table nearby.

20 minutes later the hostess/owner/manager looking woman came out and asked if we had been helped yet.  We said no and she left only to return with a small happy hour flier menu which she just handed from a distance and didn't even come over to our table.  I know you're wondering why I would wait the 15 minutes, but I really wanted to see just how bad the service was going to be and frankly, I just wanted some good $2 wine.

It's been about 5 minutes and the same woman comes back with full, detailed menus and I asked if the happy hour flier was the deals for the event and she said yes and then asked if we were ready to order.  Um, you just gave us the menus 10 seconds ago...

By now I'm ready to just order and enjoy the meal deals from the event.  I look over the happy hour flier and I see some app deals.  They said there was a specialty appetizer menu.  Not so much, but whatever.  I can deal with that.  Then I see the drink section.  The claim for the event was $2 glasses of wine.  I was excited to try some nice new wines on the cheap, but again... not so much.  In reality it was $4 glasses of house wine which only consisted of three different wines that weren't really what I was looking for.  By now, the other women that were outside decided to leave having had enough of this shenanigans.  We decided (after 30 minutes since we arrived) to go next door to Sprouts, get some apps, and have our own ""Wine Down Wednesday"" at home.

I bet there are plenty of people that will have good experiences here and continue to visit happily, but this one experience has caused me to write them off for good (which I don't usually do after one instance).  I wish that I could actually review their wine and food, but the service was so poor and substandard that it's not worth giving them my money.  I understand if the food isn't good at a restaurant - some are just better or more talented than others.  However, any business can and should have good customer service.  I think this is where the cliched line of ""if I could give them less than 1 star I would"" comes in...

Oh yeah, and I slapped down a ""You've been Yelped"" card as I left.

Take that Tastings!!"
1,"I don't think I have ever been to a restaurant where I have treated so poorly by the wait staff. I'm actually rethinking my Green rating because I sincerely think this is my worst restaurant experience.

The one good thing I can write is that this place is really cute and it has an inviting patio. Lots of string lights and cute bistro tables. I really thought I was in for a great evening. Oh how wrong I was.

My friend and I walked in and the hostess immediately sat us at a four top right in front of the door. Unless the restaurant is packed and the drafty table in front of the door is the last spot available, I do not want to sit in a place where incoming guests will constantly bump into my chair. I pointed to a seat in the back and after trying to convince me I didn't want *that* table, the hostess led us to the back. It's not the worst thing that could ever happen and that instance did not ruin my evening, it was just weird.

We sat and were greeted by our waitress, who initially seemed very nice. We both ordered water to start and I asked her for a drink menu. Apparently the drink menu is on the back of the regular menu. It's just so small that I missed it the first time. She told me that Friday night is the $4 frozen house margarita night, so I went with her suggestion. By the time I finish pulling out my ID, my dining partner was ready to order. We got a queso appetizer, the vegetarian tacos with a side salad, and the machaca plate.

While we waited, a few more groups came in, were greeted, and received their adult beverages. It had been ten minutes since I ordered my drink, so I tried to look for our waitress. 

She finally popped up five minutes later, but avoided all eye contact with our table. When she did see me, she quickly ran outside. I understand she might have had a few tables outside, but why have an inside section to wait as well? The table right next to us had an amazing server who brought them two orders of drinks in the time it took to get my water glass refilled. (Margarita was still MIA at this point.)

Then, the queso came out, brought by two hipsters. It looked like an over-microwaved styrofoam plate in a skillet and tasted just as bad. My friend tried to make the best out of the situation, but I was ready to call the manager. I really, really regret that I did not. 

Nasty queso juice dripped all over the table and there was no silverware or napkins to be found. AND no wait persons or a hostess to ask for said items. (Twenty minutes after I ordered my margarita, it was still MIA.)

Our waitress finally popped up and asked how the appetizer was. My friend cut me off and said it was different, but okay. He took rare this opportunity to ask for silverware. The waitress made an excuse that it should have been on the table already and went to grab some.  When she came back, I asked about my drink.

With another lame excuse that could have been avoided if she ever check on us in the then-thirty minute absence, she finally brought me my drink. It was OKAY, not worth $4... more like $2-3. 

Two seconds later, the food came out. At least we had silverware?

1) My veggie tacos and side salad were okay. Is it bad that the BEST part of meal was the white, iceberg lettuce salad?
2) My friend's machaca was bone dry. Isn't machaca supposed to be tender, rehydrated, and edible? 

All in all, the salsa was the best part of the meal. Yet, one cannot enjoy a dining experience on salsa alone. This was sincerely my worst experience at a restaurant and I will not go back to Mucho Gusto."
1,"It is what you would expect from any themed place called ""Heart Attack Grill"".  Mirrors on the bottom part of the bar so you can see up the skimpy outfits the ""nurses"" wear at the bar.  Van in the drive through section is painted to look like an Ambulance.  Hamburgers are named after cardiac events.

The food was bad, greasy unlimited fries and a giant hamburger that tasted as if they mixed in filler of some kind we had never experienced before.

If you plan on going, enjoy the experience cause the food will not be something you would head back for again."
1,"After looking for a car wash & vacuum in the area I selectioned Francis & Sons. I checkeed thier priced on thier website, but when I got thier the price they wanted to charge was much more, they kept trying to sell an upholstery cleaning, and then said I don't take care of my care so there would be an additional $20 to clean the black plastic exterior pieces. I only wanted a qhick exterior  clean and vacuum. They refused to honor thier website pricing and insisted that what I read on thier website was not on there. Needless to say I didn't get my car washed there. I would highly recommend AVOIDING these crooks."
1,"I am DONE with Classic Car Spa, their sub-par car washes, and their shady business partnerships.  

Whatever you do, DO NOT get your windshield replaced by the Auto Glass Shop that Classic Car Spa allows on their premises. I am holding Classic Car Spa accountable for placing their customers in such close proximity to criminals. 

While these Auto Glass Shop men are friendly and seem helpful, it is a scam. They replaced my windshield (and hey, it cost me nothing b/c my insurance covers it) and put the glass in wrong THREE TIMES! After one week and many HOURS on the phone with them and my insurance company, they are still giving me the run around. So although it was free, I will now have to foot the bill for fixing their crappy craftsmanship. 

After trying in vain to get my windshield fixed by the Auto Glass Shop, I spoke with the manager of Classic Car Spa. I don't think I've ever met a manager with a more relaxed, ""who cares?"" attitude. That place is a joke. Except, I'm not laughing...."

1,"My husband and I went to Ernie's a few weeks ago on a Saturday night because it is within walking distance to our house and there is always a crowd so we wanted to check it out. We met our friends in the bar and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited. Still no-one offered to take our drink order. 

The bartenders and barbacks made eye contact but no-one came near us. We don't look like hooligans or ruffians or anything so it was irritating. The weird thing was there were people eating in the booths around us, and one or two other people at the bar (who had drinks.) We finally got up and left. Why waste money on places that won't take it! I won't return and will recommend my friends don't either!"
1,Worse pizza I have had in a while. We ordered 3 slices and they tasted like they had been sitting out for a while and nuked. Crappy service too. Salad was plain and all oil no vinegar for dressing. . Service half ass. I am surprised they have remained in business fo several years. Also they apparantly have no AC it was VERY warm inside even on a slightly chilly day in Nov so we sat outside the inside was so hot and stuffy. this place totally sucks.

1,"I'll be charitable - this place sucks!

I went there because a friend had *exactly* the piece of furniture I needed and he got his from Ikea.   After wandering around the store forever, I finally found the right department.

The people working there were cold. uncaring. not helpful. no concept of customer service.  I left in disgust!

Couple of days later, I was in Cost Plus World Market @ 18th St. & Camelback.  Voila!  I fould what I wanted - for close to the same price.  the BIG difference:  Warm smiles, friendly people, volunteered to go out of their way to help me.  Felt like I was among long-time friends!  They even delivered when they said they would.

And, no need to drive half way to tucson and back!

Ikea?  Don't be foolish.  Cost Plus?  Now, there's a place that earned my repeat business!"
1,"After sitting at our table for 30 minutes and not getting any service, we left.  But not before the hostess said thanks for coming in. Needles to say I will not be returning."
1,"My sister recently took her '98 VW New Beetle to First Class Auto in Scottsdale, AZ for an overheating issue.  I'm normally the one who does the maintenance on the vehicle but I was ~600 miles away.  She described the symptoms as follows: overheating light came on while she was stuck in construction traffic and went back off once she was moving again.  I immediately suggested that the radiator fans may not be coming on for some reason.  Since I wasn't around to look at it, she took it to First Class Auto.

She relayed the symptoms to the guys at First Class and also SPECIFICALLY requested they check  radiator fan functionality.

They told her the water pump was cracked and leaking, needed a new thermostat and also replace the timing belt and serpentine belt while they were in there (water pump is driven by the timing belt on this engine--2.0L 8V 4 cyl AEG code).  Well, a) I personally replaced the timing belt, water pump and serpentine belt about 10,000 miles ago as preventative maintenance.  What's more is the car hasn't lost any coolant since the job.  So the water pump being cracked is highly unlikely!  I did not replace the thermostat, though.  Once she called me to tell me this, I told her to decline the work and either take it somewhere else or wait for me to make a trip out.

I had a job to do that brought me almost half way to the Phoenix area so I decided I would make the trip the rest of the way to have a look for myself yesterday.  FIRST thing I did was check the radiator fans.  I turned on the AC and the fans didn't come on at all.  I pop the cover off the strip fuse panel that resides on top of the battery and found a melted 30 AMP fuse.  Guess what that fuse is for?  The RADIATOR FANS!  Imagine that.  Being a car that lived most of its life in Michigan, some of the fuses and the fuse panel itself had become corroded and caused the one fuse and part of the fuse panel to melt.  The coolant level was exactly at the max level, right where it was after I did the maintenance on it 10,000 miles ago, not to mention I checked it before her recent trip to Scottsdale (didn't have to add anything.  The car doesn't leak a drop of coolant).

Local dealer had a new fuse panel in stock, I swapped it out and replaced all 3 of the 30 amp blade fuses as they were all corroded pretty badly.  The larger strip fuses were still decent.  The radiator fans now work as normal and the car does not overheat.  The hose coming off the thermostat also becomes pressurized and hot at the correct temperature as well, so that's definitely not a problem!  Fans also come on automatically once the coolant temp hits 99 deg Celsius like they're supposed to.  Problem solved!

I drove down to First Class Auto today to give them a chance to explain/defend themselves, but there was only one guy working in the shop who she didn't recognize and no one at the counter.  What great customer service!

So she COULD have spent the quoted $800 and STILL had the same problem!  She just got dinged for a ~$40 diagnostic fee... for an incorrect diagnosis."
1,"Went with three others. My first & last visit.  The menu did not properly describe the item and instead of a bell pepper dish, I got a port dish. It was dreadful. The other three I went with were not very happy with their meals either.  The restaurant was extremely noisy. Not pleasant at all & terrible food. Will never go back.  A big disappointment.  They can't even describe their items properly so you never know what you are going to end up with. They called it a pepper dish and it was a pork dish. The sauce apparently contained pulverized peppers. Are they stupid?  I should have trusted my instincts & not the commercial.  It's a third world country. They can barely afford to feed themselves. They have no history of cuisine.  I wouldn't waste my time and money on this place again."
1,I was really disgusted with this place. I should have known when we walked in on Saturday at 12:30 PM and there was no one (not exagerating)  there.  But we were hungry and hot so we stayed. I wanted shrimp tacos but no shrimp at tacos del MAR...just frozen fish that you need to order 5 minutes ahead because they need to microwave it.   It's breaded and precut...couldn't they at least get the kind that has different shapes and looked like it wasn't completely processed?  The kids had bean burritos which they usually love anywhere but didn't like at all. My husband's chicken burrito tasted like a school cafeteria.  The clincher was that the unsweetened ice tea tasted rancid.  I think they let the tea bags go bad or something.  Gross and how annoying that they  don't have seafood.  Wahoo tacos from La Jolla please come here to AZ!!!
1,"I came to the restaurant specifically because of a recommendation. I am now on a gluten-free diet and have other allergies so, suffice it to say, I don't get to eat Italian often. However I was told that they have gluten-free pasta and other choices. I was initially impressed by the sheet that breaks down their meals by allergen so that one knows what is safe. Kudos on that. This is more than most places provide.

However, they have Basil Pesto Sauce listed as NOT being gluten-free nor soy free. Finding that odd, I asked the waiter to confirm with the chef, and I was told there was no wheat product at all in the pesto, which seems correct. (I did not ask about the soy, but I would wager that sneaks in somehow thanks to the cheese.)

So I ordered the Create Your Own Pasta of gluten-free penne with pesto sauce, shrimp, peppers, spinach, and mushrooms.

When my bowl of pasta arrived, it had all of the above. However, it also had onions, zucchini, and eggplant, yet I had to dig to find a shrimp. I originally assumed I had somebody else's order.

The waiter, who was wonderful and attentive, took the bowl away and offered to replace it as I ordered. I would have eaten the original bowl, and told him so, but I was more concerned, as I said, that it was someone else's.

As a side note, if these flourishes of extra vegetables are an example of a cook's flair, I would say that if a customer orders a straight menu item, that might be acceptable. But when I fill out a cute little checkbox form with what I want on my Create Your Own Pasta bowl, I *only* want the items I checked off.

A fresh bowl arrived later exactly as ordered. Except the pasta was undercooked. I don't mean really firm al-dente. I mean some were still way under done. Now, I know that gluten-free pasta takes longer to cook, and they probably rushed the bowl to get it to me. But that bowl was almost inedible.

The waiter did offer to get me a third bowl. I declined and soldiered through it. We were having dinner out for my wife's birthday and I did not want to belabor the meal. The waiter then offered us dessert to make up for the problems. Though I did agree to this, and I'm not demanding or even asking for a full dinner cost to be covered, it seems inadequate for management to offer me a three dollar dessert to make up for a twice-failed $14 dinner.  I do not intend to go back."
1,"Have been going to LGO since 2003 and have always enjoyed the cuisine. Several times - either when ordering in the grocery or dining at the Pizzeria - the music has been so headsplitting as to wipe out any ambience or semblance of a welcoming neighborhood restaurant. Last night the demographic in the Pizzeria during the course of our meal ranged from 30-80 years of age. Several pleas to turn the music down just enough to be able to hear the waiter standing next to me were greeted with ""it's just how we do things"" and ""there's no point in asking because they won't turn it down even a little"". The waiter, David, said many servers consistently relay complaints but that the owner ""really doesn't care"". Hubris is so unappetizing. I think the food is great but, because I have no desire to support a business that really doesn't give a crap about its clientele, I'll spend my money lavishly elsewhere."
1,"I had received an email from a student retention telling me that I still owe money for the time that I had taken classes (two weeks) although these fools canceled my financial aid. I will sue this school if they even attempt to collect money from me and I have withdrawn from the classes on the right time, but this rep. told me that the withdrawal period was Jan. 11."
1,"Avoid at all costs. Awful service, slow as hell, only uses disposable plasticware/plates to add landfill insult to heinous food.  Despite telling them we were in a rush to catch a plane and multiple reassurances that the food would arrive in plenty of time, they lollygagged around and I ended up paying $30 to be seriously pissed off and hungry with no food.   BLECH."
1,"My wife and I live around the corner, hadn't eaten here in a few months. We got food for take out, Mongolian beef,kung po chicken,pad Thai noodles.  Mongolian beef, there were more white onions then scallions and it was very bland. Kung po chicken,lots of white meat chicken the whole dish only had one peanut and the taste of this dish was non existent. Very very Blah... Pad Thai noodles,the dish was dry and came out of the container in one giant clump. It tasted like plain noodles, i was glad I had peanut sauce in the fridge to,add to it. Then it was edible .... We will not be going back to G@S.. Very disappointed !!!! From now on it will be Jade palace on 92nd street. For take out Asian !!!!  Do yourself a favor go elsewhere !!!!"
1,"Totally dissapointed.  I had purchased a coupon from TravelZoo, to try out this restaurant, which given its location I would have thought it was going to be very upscale and we were expecting a WHOLE LOT MORE.  
The Service was great, but the food, not worth it.  The restaurant itself is very outdated, very 80's.  
My husband and I had the crab cakes for appertizer.  They were cold when they were served.  We told our waiter, who in turn told the chef, and the message was passed back to us, that she appologized.   
My Husband ordred a 12oz New York Strip ala carte for $29.95, 6 oz of that was pure fat!  and for the price you would expect to get more meat than fat!  I ordered a wild mushroom pizza, which was OK.   This place needs an over haul in a major way, if they want to make any money at the restaurant, which for a Saturday night at 7pm when we went, was empty.  I think the highlight of the meal was the bottle of cabinet!"
1,"Don't do business at this unethical business. My $25 savings account from 2009 was  recently stolen from $5 a month for ""account inactivity"" fees. They are a bunch of crooks.

It appears you now need to nickle and dime your customers with BS fees in order to stay in business. 

Account closed."
1,Jimmy Johns is cheaper and better ... The Capriotti food is heavy ... and it doesn't taste as good as you think it should taste
1,"Can someone please tell me why people go here???

Went to breakfast with Deb L, and she had a Living Social deal or one of those deal thingies. The place was packed, probably because it's a holiday week.

That doesn't excuse the EXTREMELY poor service. We sat down and waited. And waited. Servers walked by every few moments, nobody stopped to fill our water glasses or take our order. Finally, we both said something to a girl who walked by. She seems mystified that there was a job to do. With that many people working, getting a cup of coffee shouldn't take 15 minutes. Yes. 15 freaking minutes.

Food? Mediocre at best. I got the traditional eggs benedict with home fries. The only saving grace with the amount of ham on it. The English muffin didn't seem to be toasted. The eggs were *ok* but nothing great. The home fries? My 9-year old niece could do a better job. My burps right now aren't even good enough to brag about.

I'm sure if the service had been better, I wouldn't be so miserable right now. My food coma isn't satisfying. I will *never* go here again. Ever. I felt stupid leaving a tip, it was THAT bad. 

Total. Fail. Blech."
1,"Read al lthe hype, so decided to give Cyclo a try.  What a disappointment!  Portions were small and overpriced, owner thinks she's the next best thing to sliced bread.  She needs to go back to Vietnam to remember how real Vietnamese food is prepared.

Give this place a miss."
1,"Needs a new name - now.  

The Pischke's of old had such a sad ending.  I appreciated McGrath's effort to keep ""Pischke's"" alive.  But it is nothing, nothing, nothing like the Pischke's of old.  Call it ""The Blue Ribbon Cafe"" - take out the PIschke name - I can't imagine that Chris PIschke would have been honored to be remembered this way.  If his restaurant was a reflection of who he was as a person - Pischke's Blue Ribbon Cafe would be the exact opposite of who he was.  

The current restaurant is not a laid back, family friendly and yet a bar all at once restaurant that serves an unending array of crazy good sandwiches/salads/etc - the current decor is pretentious, and the food matches that."
1,"Great food can be found anywhere. Great service is one in a million these days. This place gets an A+ in the most awful service I have ever received and if you have/had a Groupon for this place like I did, don't even bother going. You'll be treated worse than a bothersome fly on a hot and humid day.

It's simple. Businesses put  their name out by working with daily coupon sites like Groupon, LivingSocial, etc., to garner new and potential repeat customers. Instead, after going there with my handy coupon, I can't help but drive by this place on the way home and think nothing but the horrible experience I received. 

I went with my boyfriend and bought the Groupon because I was impressed due to online reviews and decided to splurge on a good ole' prime rib. We sit down, am impressed with the old school decor, and then the server from Azkaban appears. We tell her that we'd like to order off the special evening menu where it's a little cheaper and tell her joyfully that we found this place through Groupon and that it's our first time. Wrong thing to do. I don't know if it's because past Groupon-ers don't tip well or something, but I could swear her smile immediately turned 180 degrees in an instant. 

It took our food (the chicken and prime rib) almost 33 minutes to come out. All we did was nom ... and nom ... and nom on the watery coleslaw and gritty liver (which isn't to blame since I was never a liver fan). Not once did our server come by our table. We watched her run into the kitchen and either not come back out for a while or attend to other tables. It was another server that came out and gave us our food so we let our frustration go since it wasn't her fault and there's no use in calling her out for nothing. We asked if she knew where our server was, and she said she would look for her. 10 minutes later, nothing, yet it was the new server who kept coming back, asking if everything was alright like a normal server should. 

Then it was time for the check and we just wanted to get out of there since we were basically ignored. 17 minutes pass, no check came even though our  table had been cleared. Our server was still MIA so we asked a random server to give us our check. He said he would tell our server to bring it back and we told him straight up that we didn't even want to see her face so another random server brought it back.

We had a table of 4 sitting next to us who even leaned over and asked us why we were being so calm when our non-existent server was treating us like crap. We didn't even want to bother waiting another 20 minutes just to talk to a manager since apparently the only way the servers here communicate is by playing Telephone so we just left after paying. The table beside us told us that they were going to complain for us since we wanted to leave, but whether they did or not I didn't even care at that point. 

To be honest, I can't even remember what the food tasted like, which isn't quite fair in a review. I went here a couple of months ago, but I have never had an experience where service overrode the taste of food. I'm pretty sure prisoners in a cafeteria get more attention than I did.

Maybe it wasn't even the Groupon. Who knows. All I know is that we ran out of there like Usain Bolt and tell anyone who asks about our worst dining experience that this is the place to experience it."
1,"Went to Fatburger with our family tonight and will not return. 

Average food. The burgers were average. The lettuce was wilted, the tomato was green, and nothing outstanding about the flavor. I'd say better options nearby are Joe's farm grill, In-n-out, or Culvers. 

Cleanliness was average. The floor was a little sticky and the beverage area was kept very neat. The kitchen appeared clean. 

Service was below average/horrible. The cashier was very unpleasant. We all ordered at the same time and the first half of the food came out about 15 minutes prior to the 2nd part. It was pretty slow. By the time we got the fries they were cold. The staff literally acted like they were a bunch of highschoolers who were annoyed that there were any customers who interrupted their hangout. 

I know this sounds harsh...it is. My experience was absolutely horrible. We will not be back and I don't recommend that you should either."
1,"I was severely mislead by Frank A's, ""It's hot, but the food ain't bad."" review.  It was very cold and by far the worst food I've ever eaten.  You would have to drag me here in cuffs to get me to return."
1,"I was there on a Friday night with a few friends in the hopes of a quick drink and nosh after a show next door.
My companion and I ordered basic drinks and were met with shots of liquor in the bottoms of our glasses and a blank look from the waitress when I asked if they were out of mixers.  After this, we opted not to order any food (taking our cue from the inability to mix gin with tonic water) and were met with an outrageous bill (for our two 'well' shots).  We questioned the tally and were met with a second total that wasn't much better.  
Our credit card was charged twice: $40 for some wet ice and a lemon wedge.  There are many cool and artsy places in Phx where we can catch live music and nosh with friends.  I'll pass this one up from now on."
1,"I went today with three friends for dinner around 6 PM Sunday night. Though it seemed quite busy, I was pleased to get a seat within two minutes upon arrival. Outside seating, despite a hot Arizona summer, was pretty nice with shade. However, this is where the pleasanties end.

Our table remain neglected for approximately twenty minutes. No one bothered to offer us drinks, and it was quite irritating to see tables who arrived after us being served appetizers. When our waiter came, he did not even apologize for the wait, and we gave our orders: drinks, appetizers, and pita sandwiches.

The hummus and garlic dip came relatively quickly, only twenty minutes later. Both were alright, but something is seriously wrong if all of us were only served one pita with the two dips, and each dip was more than twice the size of the pita. We asked our waiter for extra pita, and he kindly agreed. The entire duration of dinner, it never came.

Refills were also a pain, as we would ask someone to fetch our waiter, and he wouldn't come until ten minutes later.

An hour after ordering could not possibly justify only four meager gyro sandwiches. I've been to plenty of other businesses who have made that kind of order and more in just ten minutes during a busy lunch hour. Half the tables outside already left, including tables that arrived after us, and we were the last ones served. The food was of average quality, and I've been to better with cheaper prices.

Slightly expensive, I can see as justified. But many agree that time is worth much more than money. I had an excessive amount, over an hour and a half, wasted on a decellerating Sunday night. Staff is kind of nice, but I suggest a serious change in priorities so that first time customers like myself aren't immediately turned off. I can say for certain that I'm never coming here again, and I'll find myself at better places much closer to home."
1,"""Fake"" (or rather condescending) service from the ""Service Manager""...and he didn't even acknowledge me when I asked the status of my car (uh, more like IGNORE). Ended every sentence with an impolite ""No ma'am"" or ""Yes, ma'am""... ya get the scenario. Basically, the guy was a real JERK.

They couldn't even figure out HOW to fix my car, even when I TOLD them what was wrong with it ( had been diagnosed at the Dealership). Two guys were sitting there staring at the computer (as if it was going to magically speak to them). At least they didn't charge me, but what a waste of time waiting for 90 minutes...."
1,"So I had this important event to attend in California and I've already spent a lot of money preparing for my trip. Earlier in the month I had received a coupon for $40 off any service at Epic salon. Wow, that is a lot of savings and I could sure use to save some money. Epic uses  Goldwell products which is my product of choice. I just needed a tint touch-up (about 1"") so I went to this salon... I had already had an awesome experience at another salon in town, but I couldn't pass up the savings by using the $40 coupon)  I was second-guessing the idea of trying a new salon since I had already found one I absolutly loved. .Again though, the coupon lured me in. Anyway, I walked away with the worst experience ever. Not only was my color wrong ( I am a golden blonde and she colored my 1' outgrowth to a 3"" ash) when I went back in to explain what was so wrong with it (5min later), the front desk lady was rude and cut me off as I was speaking to her. Not the best way to handle a pissed of lady expecially about her hair! I gave them a chance to fix it and the only thing they did was put a gold glaze on my hair, which did not help at all.  The style sucked too. I just left. I did not have time to see if they could fix it again. I will not be going back to this place for any services. Noy only because the hair experience was bad, but because the front desk gal made a bad impession of the place even worse with her nastiness. UGH! I will give this place 1 star only because on the coupon was also a savings of 30% off products."
1,"I am furious.

In the last 12 months, I have had at least scheduling issues, from them calling me at 8AM on a Saturday morning (my 1 day off) to cancel my 11am appointment to last Saturday, when I went in only to be told someone had messed up, and actually booked me for the NEXT week, and despite me driving all the way out there at 11am, they couldn't get me in until maybe that evening, and then not with someone who had experience in deep tissue/medical massage. I was irritate and ready to ask for my membership refunded then, but Ashley the clinic manager promised me that they'd give me my next week appointment free of charge, and that she'd personally be certain there were no more issues.  As I literally couldn't turn my head to the left due to pain, I took her up on that. BIG MISTAKE.

Yesterday (the Friday before my ""correctly"" scheduled massage, I went out of my way to call in and confirm my own bloody appointment, to try and avoid last week's debacle. According to the woman who answered the phone, it looked like my schedule therapist was actually scheduled off, but she went to talk with her manager, and came back to the phone telling me everything was ok, and that she'd call with any issues. Then yesterday evening, I got ANOTHER confirmation call from Massage Envy, confirming and reminding me of my 11:30am appt on Saturday with my preferred therapist. GIven that I've had 3 migraines this week (versus my 0 or 1 when I get a massage the weekend prior), I really absolutely needed to get in, so I felt more confident.

Well, I was just woken up at 8am...again. On my day off...again. To explain to me that, big shock, they messed up my scheduling again, and that apparently, my therapist was off today. Despite Ashley's promise of it not happening again. Despite me being pro-active and calling to confirm. I am sitting here in pain, so furious at this repeated treatment that I can't even go back to bed...and the best part? They don't even have a manager on duty I can complain to.

My treatment at the hands of the booking/front desk staff has been any thing BUT relaxing. I continue to walk out of there frustrated, angry, and occasionally in tears. I know they say Fool Me Once, Shame On You, Fool Me Twice, Shame On Me, but I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. I'm pretty screwed for today and the next week, but luckily, an Elements place with a similar concept opened recently in the general area. At this point, it literally cannot be any worse than massage envy. As much as I love Talisha and Aisha as massage therapists, getting a massage should feel good, and not like you're just a number to them, not like you actually have to spend more time trying to get a damn appointment than you actually get to spend IN the appointment."
1,"First off, the restaurant is dim and dark.. I thought the decor was a little off because they were going for a tropical Vietnam theme with banana trees in there and a waterfall fountain. The waiter there did not have a smile and didn't seem freindly, it looked like this was the last place he wanted to be at. The service sucked ass. I mean come on, there was only two tables including mines and 3.9/4 of the time, he didn't check up on us or refilled our water and we had to walk up to ask for our bill.. like seriously...? Are you that lazy. Bun Bo Hue was skimpy on the meat and had little veggies on the side. Pho had a rancid smell. Noodles in my sister's bun thit nuong were hard and watery (seemed like they were super old) Overall, I wouldn't recommend to ANYBODY."
1,"False ads, do not stay there. Unless you don't mind a dirty, smelly, overrated hotel. The sheets and towels that were supposed to be white were gray. The place is run down and poorly serviced. The front lobby is clean but once you head up to your room you quickly find out that the place is run down and not being taken care of. I stayed on the fifth floor ""cabana suites"" and as soon as my elevator opened up on the fifth floor, I knew right away I stayed at the wrong place. The ""suites"" were nothing more than a room with a tiny bit of extra elbow space that are on the rooftop area with a pool in the front of the room. The pool was NASTY! (see pictures I uploaded) It was green and looked disgusting and when I arrived to take a look, it had an ""out of order"" sign placed at the entrance. This place was embarrassing! I had told my brothers to book there with me because we thought it was going to be a great hotel based on their website but we were very disappointed again!"
1,Horrible service. Twice now I've gone there and they keep messing up my drink. I work for Starbucks!! It's not hard to get a drink right! Believe me. Horrible service. The people that work there All have bad attitude. One lady doesn't even look at you when your ordering your drink. I think that someone needs to go In there and fix it and make it a welcoming Starbucks that it's known for. Ya a few of the employees that work there are absolutely wonderful but when you get that one that is just rude it just makes you not want to go there anymore. I stopped going. They still get my drink wrong when my mom goes to get coffee. Horrible.
1,"""The office space, layout, presentation gets 5 stars, the customer service you receive from the employees at Corporate Office Center is a negative 10. They will scare your clients off, scare your own staff and make your life a living hell. Their office locations and space is beautiful but if a say, a client shows up at a time other than their scheduled time, they will be told to leave. They will be told you don't provide any services at the locations and if anyone could single handedly ruining your professional image, Corporate Office Centers can do this for you! BE AFRAID!!!!

1,"Worst store in the chain - I agree with one poster that it's not crowded but it also is out of items more than any other store.  It also is so understaffed it's impossible to get help if you need it and if you ask someone that works here that you finally locate, my experience is that they wont know what your asking for anyway.  I recently was in the store asking about a certain item by Susan Lenart Kazmer, the person looked right at me and said oh we don't carry that artist you might try hobby lobby they get a little credit for trying to help but Susan's line is a Michaels only item.  I gave the woman the line name and said no we don't carry that I'm sure.  I pointed at the huge display in front of me of Susan items and her answer, Oh that must be brand new.  I said nope it came out three years ago now can you see if you have this specific item she said oh we can't do that and she walked off talking to her friend the only other employee in the store that i had seen.   Ok bad but any store can have a bad employee right.  so I go up to pay, a pleasant young girl asks me if I have a Michael's card?  I say sure do and hand it to her.  Oh that's not a Michaels card ours are red.  I explain that it's a gold card for people who spend more money and that as a professional artist I'm there quite a bit.  She says I've never heard of that before.  Well it's a Michaels card just read the front it says Michaels right there.  she stands looking at me so I said try scanning it I promise it will work.  She scans it and then says oh it says you have a $5  off coupon loaded on this card.  My response;  good you get a five dollar coupon for every 100 you spend.  Now she looks scared and says the dreaded words I'm not sure,  let me call the manager.  So 20 minutes go by and who shows up the lady that argued about the Susan Lenart items.  They finally agree to try it and I'm finally out the door just 40 minutes later.  And that's not even the bad part!   I went into this store to have something framed that was three weeks ago they tell me every day it will be the next day all to no avail they use every excuse imaginable custom frames take time, or custom mat colors are hard to get.   Each time I explain it's a off the shelf frame there only cutting a black mat.  they say oh that should be fast will have it tomorrow.  

I wouldn't shop here again if it was all free this store is a joke just keep driving and go to the large store at Power and McKellip's it's a much larger store with competent staff and about twice the selection.   It's well worth the drive and the cost of gas I live less than two miles from the gateway store and can still drive make my purchases and drive home much faster than trying to shop at the local gateway store.  They have even  framed two other items while I'm still waiting for the Gateway store to cut a simple mat."
1,"After several hundred professional massages over the past 20 years, I encountered today a first -- a massage therapist who explained that she could not do a massage involving any but mild pressure using her hands. It was an issue of ""protecting the thumbs."" When I told her I didn't like forearms and elbows, she explained that she'd never worked without using her forearms (and, I assume, her elbows, too). After just five minutes, when I asked for more pressure, she suggested we stop the massage -- that she wasn't the ""therapist for [me]."" She was right. What are they teaching these people these days, and why doesn't an excellent outfit like LifeTime Fitness insist on better skills among its massage staff? I won't offer her name, but, if considering a massage at this establishment, I suggest Casie as the only therapist here worth the money."
1,"HELLISH HELLISH SUMMER WEATHER (March thru October)
it hurts my lungs to breath.

I couldn't get transcripts because I had a parking ticket I needed to pay.
The problem is... *i DON'T OWN A CAR, I don't drive, I don't even have a drivers license*!!
~*~*-- aside from that one minor incident,~*~*

I paid 9000 USD a semester to receive a so and so education.
I graduated with a magna cum laude. I have attended other universities. However, I couldn't help but notice the gap in the quality and variety of classes offered.

For example, you have to be a finance major to take upper level interesting finance classes.

Business school was so and so, a lot of repetition.
Very little hands-on and help with internships.
Way too much groupwork and free-riding.
They do not have many good employers at their semi annual recruiting events.

Oh, and professors rarely teach the courses.
They have their teaching assistants teach us.

Also, there is a lack of bridging classes between lower level and upper level classes.
 Junior year when you get admitted into the ""professional program"" the level of the classes and transition isn't too smooth.

The campus tutoring program is pretty helpful for general classes if you're having trouble with classes (usually lower level)

There are not enough chairs/desks in some classes.
The students sit on the floor and cram on the stairs in the lecture halls.

Also, the classes don't teach you how to think critically, which I think is crucial in college.
Please don't waste your money, especially those of you from out of state. Its not worth it.

Expect to wait in line wherever you go.
ASU accepts way too many people.
It would prolly accept my cat and my baby sister who barely talks if we threw money at them.

Thus its very difficult to get myself into the classes I need.
The advisors are walking advertisements of the business school.
They are not informed enough to advise you.

I got dropped from two required prerequisite courses so I could not move on to the next level.... even after pre-registration.
I got screwed and ended up having to take one more semester to graduate.

Tuition rose from 6000 a semester in Fall of 2003 to 9000 + in Fall of 2007.
Gross!!

One thing I liked was the student theatre performances. The admission $ was reasonable and quite entertaining.

The College of Architecture and Environmental design studios are pretty good and has good security.

ASU is not the most safe neighborhood.
I have been approached by many shady people.

do NOT live on campus. Especially the dorms on north campus.
They are beyond crappy and overpriced.
You have to split your room with a room mate in most cases for undergrads.
The ""freshman year experience"" bullsh*t they pull on you, don't buy it.
and Please PLEASE please don't move into Manzy Hall (Manzanita; 15 stores with triangular windows).

I lived here my froshy year and its the dirtiest (rats), unhealthy (mold, pot circulation), most promiscuous place on campus.

Again, please don't bother wasting your money, especially if your an out of state or international student. 
Hope this helps."
1,"Went here one night with a group of friends. This place is pink, crowded, and really not that impressive. I ordered some sorbet and it was bland - that in itself is an accomplishment - bland sorbet.  The 50's style booth seats were very uncomfortable (maybe to discourage staying long?) and the tables were the wrong height for eating. I had to strain to get above face level of my food (and i'm a normal sized woman) It was also very very (very) loud in here.

I'll avoid going here again. The quality of the product was just too poor - I'd rather hit up a Whole Foods and get some good sorbet without the discomfort and echoing nosie."
1,"Absolutely waste of time & space is this establishment. Don't bother checking in with the host to be seated as I saw many people just seat themselves although there was a 20 min wait for others, the staff rude, uncaring & could possibly be where all the servers go that can't get a job in any other Resteraunt. A complete disgrace & I would never give such a place my hard earned money, I suggest you do the same."
1,"This was a terrible experience.  You can not reach anyone via phone, you have to book online, which I did and also requested a phone call.  I rcvd no call and had an email in my email confirming a time for cleaning.  I requested a call then and got a reply stating someone would call me in 15 mins.  Still no call.  The cleaners arrived & I had someone let them in.  When I returned they were to clean the bathrooms & they were TERRIBLE TERRIBLE!  The sinks were dirty, with tooth paste splatters on sink, the inside of the shower had brown marks from some sort of un rinsed product.  I am so unhappy about this.  I have tried to reach them every day since & have not recieved a call back from a voice mail or email.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY THEY ARE AWEFUL!"
1,"This is my very first review and I can't say I feel bad for what I am about to write. I took everyones review hoping for a really good hotdog and onion rings like the reviews I read (best hot dog ever, amazing hotdog., etc) oh man were we disappointed.  I'd have to say I'd go to cocstco for a hotdog for $1.50 with a drink."
1,"I have been here once for lunch and sat outside only to get eaten alive by flies, nothing worse than eating outside on a nice patio and being pestered the entire time. 

I decided to give it another chance for happy hour, well guess what? flies followed me inside too. 

I don't know if it was the time of year (early spring) or what, but they really need an exterminator!"
1,"Well...no worries for the continued bad service...awful prices...average inventory....and just overall bad experience....because the store closes forever this weekend. I have never cared for the place....so I definitely won't miss it. However if your looking for some decent electronic gear at 60-80% off....then this is your weekend to go. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends"
1,Ive eaten here twice and I dont think Ill ever eat here again. I ordered the lettuce wraps and the food smelled like horrible BO. It made me so nauseous I couldnt even eat it. The salad is decent but I still cant get over that smell!
1,"I was so looking forward to breakfast here. What a disappointment.

The food is the only thing that rates any stars at all. Good ingredients cannot be completely ruined by incompetent service.

The space is nice, but crowded and loud. The counter staff were indifferent. After being waved over to an open register, the fellow behind the counter took one order, then wandered off, leaving the rest of us to get back in line at the other register to order.

You are given a number (or not) and left to find your own table, scrounge up your own silverware, and wait for your food to be delivered. Except that the napkins are at a completely different station than the silver, they were out of forks, and most of the tables were completely filthy. I watched a busboy randomly swipe the top of a table, sweeping crumbs onto the benches and chairs, then leave an empty drink bottle on the table before wandering listlessly off.

Beverages are (apparently) serve yourself, although they didn't bother to say that when I ordered. I stood at the counter, waiting for iced tea, only to turn around and see that I was expected to get it myself.

If they happen to ""run out of numbers"", then they input your name with your order. Nothing irritates me more than to have my name shouted across a restaurant. Better yet, the waiters wander from table to table looking for their customers.... ""Lisa? Is there a Lisa here?"" while your food cools. Inexcusable.

The only bright point: the croque madame was tasty. Delicious bread, ham, and a perfectly fried egg. But the meager smear of bechamel and a thin slice of cheese were underwhelming. However, the ""side of fruit"" made me angry: a tiny metal creamer with 1 blackberry, a few slices of strawberry, and 2 chunks of  green apple. Insulting.

Fast casual, order at the counter works well when tables are clean and set, and the food delivery is speedy and efficient. Unfortunately this place needs some work in order to make it worth your time."
1,"Gross, repulsive, appauling, disgusting, overrated, dirty, should be shut down by the CDC.  You get the jist?"
1,"Great donuts but horrible service... Didn't get anything we wanted due to a language barrier between us and the limited English speaking employee. She claimed, in broken English, to only speak Spanish. She understood ONLY the word ""dozen"" and we got a dozen of what ever she felt like giving us, then proceeded to ignore us while using her cell phone!
Donut shops are a dime a dozen and we will never again return to Bosa."
1,"I had such a nice experience here - Classic Chicken - the first time that I really wanted to go back. Second time, onion strings were so greasy I couldn't eat them, burger was okay. Third time, yesterday? Enough to say we wont go back. Ever. 

Lovely and I sat in a sticky booth, he ordered 1/3 lb classic, me the bbq grilled chicken - both with a small soda. Soda was disgusting, flat, watery, gross. Upon the lovely's complaint, the bus boy brought him bottled water. I took one bite of my sandwich and was assaulted by hair. Gak. We got up and left our food. Jeff told the manager about the food and the soda, we got our money back with an apology saying they were sorry we 'didn't have a better experience'. Um. A better experience??? Seriously? 15 dollars? 

Ugh."
1,"This place was the worst place to EVER live! I lived here from Aug 2010 to may 2011, i was always in the office see when the grates would be fixed?? the office always gave me the run around very rude. You would think after the gun shoots, assaults, and car break ins that they would fix the gates but nope and to this day they still aren't fixed. When we moved in they said they would be fixed in a week and they lied.  Also the gym is huge but NONE of the equipment works! living here was SO gross! nothing worked our neighbors are Mexican thugs doing drug cat calling at anything that walks it was gross. I hated living here! 

 But the worst part was a few weeks ago we get a call from collections saying we owe Scottsdale Springs $300 bucks over 10 months after moving out! I called them up like wtf, and they were SO rude said too bad pay it or your credit score will hurt, we even gave a fowarding address and we NEVER got a letter in the mail about any damages. They claim we never gave them a forwarding address which is bull. 

I really hope people read these reviews i would hate to see anyone else scammed by this god awful company!"
1,"HORRIBLE service - did nothing to correct our experience.

On July 7, 2011, my date  and I arrived around 6:30 pm, well dressed and ready to enjoy a celebratory dinner without any financial limitations. We would have easily spent $250+.

Instead, after an hour of being seated  to review our menus we were never offered more than a cocktail.

Tables around us were receiving quality attention by other servers...complete with the run down of the specials, house favorites, answering questions, etc. We, on the other hand, were lucky to have our make server look at us, much less take us to the next step our level in our dining experience.

When the table behind us, seated a good 15 mins after us, received bread before we were, my date and I decided that was our tipping point and would not stay any longer.

When our server came to ask if we were ready to order we informed him  we would not be staying for dinner  and would like the bill for the cocktail.

Never once did the server apologize, offer what he could do to make things right, etc. 

Needless to say, we were stunned. The hostess thanked us for dining on our way out...again, we both gritted our teeth with frustration. However, later we discovered that after an hour of sitting in the dining room, we were there long enough to enjoy a meal. It's unfortunate we never got the opportunity to, however.

What did go right was...we were promptly seated and the cocktail server provided decent service."
1,"Sadly, I'm giving this place one star and an explanation why it is only getting one star.  The Manger/operator guy.

Sure, the food here isn't all that bad.  Probably a half a notch or so higher than most of the hot slop fast food you can get for lunch.  Most of the crew members are pretty attentive, don't seem to be meth addicted, and I see them cleaning the tables on a regular basis.  Looks like the crew changes over quite often, and I know why.

My beef is not with the crew members, oh no.  Not with the food or cleanliness of the store.  Nope.  The Manager guy, the guy who looks like a real pussy version of John Leguizamo.  This guy ruins about every trip I have to this joint.  That is my problem with this joint.  Elaboration will proceed now.

This guy is without a doubt one of the biggest assholes I have ever encountered in the fast food industry.  Actually, one of the biggest assholes period.  What a douche bag.  Seems like any time I have a coupon, this guy will literally butt in the middle of the order, give me a ration of shit and do about anything possible not to use it.  Seriously, what is it, 30 cents?  I had a store coupon that was on a tray liner a while ago and this nutsack got in the middle of the order, cancelled it and refused to let the coupon be used.  I asked why and he said it was not legit (why was it on the tray liner then fuckhead?) I checked the menu, they would have lost 10 cents.  Lady taking my order after P.J.L. (pussy John Leguizamo) walked away pretty embarassed said ""sorry""  Not her fault.  Never saw her working there after then, was probably tired of that guys shit.  I don't blame you.

Last trip here, they have promos on their drink cups for free shit.  Awesome.  We all know this is the garbage that costs them nothing but I am a sucker for something free.  On my trip before the last, I got one for a free corndog.  SCORE!  I cash it in on my last trip, and the guy ringing up the order said it would be on a different ticket.  No sweat, I could give a shit less as long as I get my corndog.  Go to get my order, ask where the corndog is.  P.J.L. butts in the middle of the order, says ""This is your order, this is what you have"" and was a fucking prick about it.  Me, the customer.  Yanks the receipt out of my hand, gives me an attitude about it.  Who the fuck talks to a customer like that, even at a low rent fast food joint?  Fuck you.  Seriously.  The guy who took my order tried to explain the situation and dicknose literally looks at him, puts his hand in front of the guys face, and says ""ssssshhhhhh"" and snaps his fingers the same way I do to my dogs to keep them barking or eating drywall.  Who degrades their employees like that?  All he was trying to do was explain my free item was on another ticket.  Instead of listening, he made a complete asshat out of himself.  It was a corndog, what does that cost you anyway, about 12 cents in batter, a stick, and a combination of horse eyeballs and badger penis meat?  

Dude (cashier guy, tattoo on your arm), tell that guy to get fucked and get a better job.  No one deserves that shit.  I am actually ashamed I didn't say something for you, I truly am.

What would have normally gotten a decent review is what it is.  My rant speaks for itself.  One shithead ruins it for the ones working for him.  For the ones working there, I will pray for you.  You need it.  P.J.L., get out of there and become a pimp in Tijuana, they need midget controlling assholes over there.  You would do great at that."
1,"Not that any SBUX is worth going out of your way for, but this one is worth skipping. The service I've experienced each time I've been is pretty dang poor and the drinks always seem quite cold."
1,"The reviews were so good that my friend and I had to check it out. We were very disappointed this morning while trying to eat breakfast and swatting tons of flies!!! They were everywhere, on us, our food, the other customers - and this was inside.  The egg sandwiches were served on hamburger buns shaped like rolls - I could have went next door to get one just like it at McDonalds.  Not surprised people from Ahwatukee like this place, it looks nice but the food is so-so."
