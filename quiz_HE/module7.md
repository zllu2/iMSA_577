Question 1: What is the default value of n_clusters in KMeans estimator?

- 2
- 4
- 6
- * 8

Question 2: Which technique can be used to convert a dataset with 10 features to a dataset with 2 features?

- Clustering
- Classification
- Regression
- * Principal Component Analysis

Question 3: Which technique can be used to determine eps in DBSCAN?
- Elbow method
- * K-distance graph

Question 4: Which clustering method is prefered when the clusters in the dataset have similar density but very complicated geometric shapes?
- K-Means
- DBSCAN

Question 5: In a DBSCAN model, a larger epsilon leads to:
- More core points
- Less core points
- More noises
- Less noises

Question 6: In a DBSCAN model, a larger min_samples leads to:
- More core points
- Less core points
- More noises
- Less noises
