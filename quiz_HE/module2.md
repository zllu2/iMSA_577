- Question 1: True or Fasle? In a linear regression, when encode a categorical feature, one hot encoding normally leads to a better regression result(r-squared) than label encoding.
-* True
- False

- Question 2: True or Fasle? In a decision tree classification, when encode a categorical feature, one hot encoding normally leads to a better result(accuracy score) than label encoding.
- True
-* False

- Question 3: True or False? When you run following code twice, each time you will get same train and test set.
d_train, d_test, l_train, l_test = train_test_split(data, label, test_size=0.4)

- True
-* False

- Question 4: A classification model is built and trained to predict whether a loan will be paid off or not. The model achieves very high accuracy score when apply to the training set but very poor accuracy score when apply to the test set. What problem does this model have?
-* Overfitting
- Underfitting

- Question 5:(Module 3 review question) Which of the following statements is true for KNN?
- KNN doesn't have model hyperparameters.
-* KNN doesn't have model parameters.

- Question 6:(Module 3 review question) Which of the following statements are true for Random Forest?
-* Each tree in the random forest is trained on a subset of original dataset.
- Each subset dataset has same number of features as the original dataset.
-* Random Forest is less prone to overfitting comparing to Decision Tree.

- Question 7:(Module 3 review question) True or False? Support vector machine has high demand on memory with large dataset.
- True
-* False

- Question 8:(Module 3 review question) True or False? KNN has high demand on memory with large dataset.
-* True
- False
