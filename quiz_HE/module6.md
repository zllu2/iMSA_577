- Question 1: True or False? In a document term matrix built from a large corpus, most cells have value 0.
- * True
- False

- Question 2: 1% of people have a certain genetic defect. A genetic testing is used to detect the defect. For people who have the defect, the test shows positive 99% of the time. For people who don't have the defect, the test shows negative 99% of the time. So the test claims a 99% accuracy rate. If a person is tested positive by this test, what is the likelihood that the person really has the defect?

- 99%
- 75%
- 50%
- 25%

- Question 3: Which of the following models have coef_ attribute that can be used to retrieve top words in a text classfication problem?
- RandomForest
- * LogisticRegression
- * LinearSVC
- DecisionTree

- Question 4: True or False? Applying n-gram always improves text classfication accuracy.
- True
- * False

- Question 5: (Module 7 review question): True or False? Dataset spliting is not needed in clustering.
- * True
- False

- Question 6: (Module 7 review question): True or False? Feature scaling is necessary for K-Means clustering.
- * True
- False

- Question 7: (Final project review question): In the final project, the zero model has 85% accuracy rate since 85% of all loans are paid off. Is it possible that a model with lower than 85% accuracy actually helps us to choose loans to invest?

- * Yes
- No

- Question 8: (Final project review question): In the final project, assume positive means loan is paid off. What is the goal of the classification model?
- High accuracy
- High positive precision
- High positive recall
- High positive precision and decent positive recall
