    "## Difference between filter methods and wrapper methods\n",
    "- Filter methods measure the relevance of features by their correlation with dependent variable while wrapper methods measure the usefulness of a subset of feature by actually training a model on it.\n",
    "- Filter methods are much faster compared to wrapper methods as they do not involve training the models. On the other hand, wrapper methods are computationally very expensive as well.\n",
    "- Filter methods use statistical methods for evaluation of a subset of features while wrapper methods use cross validation.\n",
    "- Filter methods might fail to find the best subset of features in many occasions but wrapper methods can always provide the best subset of features.\n",
    "- Using the subset of features from the wrapper methods make the model more prone to overfitting as compared to using subset of features from the filter methods."
