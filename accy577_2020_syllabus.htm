<h2 id="a4">Elements of the Course</h2>
<p>This University of Illinois course for graduate credit or academic credit will be conducted through two platforms: (1) the <a href="https://compass2g.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Illinois Compass 2g course management system</a>, which will be your main point of contact, and (2) the Coursera Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platform where you will need to register and complete one MOOC brought to you by the University of Illinois. The Coursera MOOC is titled <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-accounting-python/home/welcome" target="_blank">Machine Learning for Accounting with Python</a>.</p>
<h3>Live Sessions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tuesdays, 8:30 AM–10:00 AM and 8:15 PM–9:45 PM US Central Time
<ul>
<li>These sessions are designed to mainly discuss cases, readings, and assignments from just completed module(s) and to preview the same from immediately upcoming module(s)</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Note: there is NO live session for module 1</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Starting April 6, participants need to enter the password "gies" (lower case) when entering the live sessions.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In order to get more value from this course, try to fit these live sessions into your schedule and participate</li>
<li>Live sessions will be recorded, and the recordings will generally be available within one hour after the last live session concludes</li>
<li>Attendance in the Live Sessions is strongly recommended. You are responsible for the content covered during the live session. If you are unable to attend, you must watch the recoding.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Office Hours</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fridays 6:00 to 7:00 PM US Central Time and by appointment</li>
<li>Saturdays 10:00 to 11:00 AM US Central Time and by appointment</li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">There is NO office hour for module 1</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Starting April 6, participants need to enter the password "gies" (lower case) when entering the office hours.</span></strong></li>
<li>The office hours provide students an additional opportunity to log in and ask questions, and thus, they serve as an additional resource to the discussion forums.</li>
<li>These times will be open and informal for student questions and will not be recorded.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a5">Assignments, Exams, and Grading</h2>
<h3>Assignment and Exam Information</h3>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Live Session Quizzes  </strong>There will be a short quiz for every live session. These quizzes assess your understanding of the Coursera material as well as ask for your opinions. We will use the quiz results to guide the live session discussions. Even if you're not able to attend either of the live sessions, you still need to finish the quiz. The quiz questions are short essay questions. As long as you finish the quizzes before the deadline you will get full credit for the quizzes. But it is highly recommended that you finish the live session quizzes before the corresponding live sessions so that we can discuss them during live session.</li>
<li><strong>HE (High Engagement) Programming Assignment </strong>These programming assignments (based on Jupyter Notebooks) are similar to and an extension of the Jupyter Notebook assignments that are posted on Coursera. Specifically, you will be asked to perform a greater number of coding tasks that require more thought than the tasks in the Jupyter Notebook assignments on Coursera. It is intended that you complete these notebook assignments after having completed the module's Coursera material and after either attending the live session or viewing the live session recording and before the deadline.</li>
<li><strong>Final Project (Group-based)</strong> The final project will give you an opportunity to go through the CRISP-DM framework for analyzing financial data in Python. You will be given a dataset and will be asked to perform a number of tasks associated with understanding, preparing the data, creating, evaluating and optimizing machine learning models, providing data-driven recommendations.  The final project is a group project. Each group needs to submit a Juypter notebook report and a video presentation. This final project will be made available during the week of Module 4.</li>
<li><strong>Teammate Evaluation </strong>You will need to submit a teammate evaluation for the final project. You will receive 20 points as long as you submit the evaluation before the deadline, which is the same as the final project. Your final project grade will be adjusted based on the evaluations of your teammates. The teammate evaluation will be made available during the week of Module 7.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>In order to pass this for-credit course, you <strong>MUST</strong> pass <strong>the associated Coursera course with a Course Certificate.</strong><strong> Failure to pass the Coursera MOOC by the indicated deadlines </strong>will result in a final grade of "I" for this for-credit course.

<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Each module starts on Monday and ends on Sunday in the </span>iMSA<span style="font-size: 13px;"> courses.</span></p>
<p>Please pay special attention to the deadlines posted here in Compass2g. These are the hard deadlines for all activities in this Compass course. You will also see deadlines posted in Coursera or in emails from Coursera; those are suggested deadlines that your instructor expects you to follow in order to prepare you for the weekly assignments in the Compass course. These may differ from the deadlines posted in Compass. In cases of mismatch, Compass is the source of truth for all course deadlines. The hard deadline for MOOC assignments is the end of this 8-week Compass2g course. In another word, by the end of this course, you should finish both MOOC assignments and Compass2g assignments by the end of Module 8. </p>
<p>At the start of any course, read and know the course syllabus and note <strong>all deadlines</strong> for assignments, quizzes and final project. The iMSA program has strict rules around deadlines and submissions.</p>
<p><strong>Late submissions of assignments made within one week after the deadline will be accepted with a 25% penalty. Submissions made more than one week after the deadline will not be accepted. Any exceptions will be at the discretion of the program. Faculty will determine the extension deadline for approved exceptions. Once the answer key is posted, late submissions are not accepted for any reason.</strong> When at all possible, requests for an exception should be made <strong>BEFORE</strong> the assignment deadline.</p>
<p>Students who experience a serious extenuating circumstance beyond their control that prevents submission of an assignment or exam may request an exception to this policy by providing documentation of the extenuating circumstance to the online program at <a href="mailto:imsa-support@illinois.edu">imsa-support@illinois.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Extenuating circumstances that may result in an exception:</p>
<ul>
<li>unforeseen hospitalization of the student or an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent)</li>
<li>death of an immediate family member</li>
<li>another similar event (natural disaster, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Circumstances that would not warrant an exception includes business travel, minor illnesses, internet access, etc. Such requests will not be granted. We ask you to plan in advance if there is uncertainty in your schedule or course work environment.</p>

<h3>Building Emergency Procedures</h3>
<p>If you ever attend class virtualy from on campus, the following building procedures apply. In the event of a tornado warning, please seek shelter in the Wohlers Hall basement or the Armory, or in the BIF basement between 8 am and 4:30 pm weekdays (the nearest designated University tornado shelters). If a tornado is imminent, the BIF basement stairwells also can be used on an emergency basis. In the event of a fire in BIF, exit BIF and proceed to 141 Wohlers Hall. In the event of threat from a shooter on campus, lock down the classroom and move to a place of safety within the classroom. If you encounter a suspicious package, do not touch the package; alert campus security, and refrain from cell phone usage until the situation is resolved. More detailed information and action instructions are available in the Building Emergency Action Plan.</p>
<h3>Campus Emergency Statement</h3>
<p>Emergencies can happen anywhere and at any time, so it’s important that we take a minute to prepare for a situation in which our safety could depend on our ability to react quickly. Take a moment to learn the different ways to leave this building. If there’s ever a fire alarm or something like that, you’ll know how to get out and you’ll be able to help others get out. Next, figure out the best place to go in case of severe weather – we’ll need to go to a low-level in the middle of the building, away from windows. And finally, if there’s ever someone trying to hurt us, our best option is to run out of the building. If we cannot do that safely, we’ll want to hide somewhere we can’t be seen, and we’ll have to lock or barricade the door if possible and be as quiet as we can. We will not leave that safe area until we get an Illini-Alert confirming that it’s safe to do so. If we can’t run or hide, we’ll fight back with whatever we can get our hands on. If you want to better prepare yourself for any of these situations, visit <a href="https://police.illinois.edu/emergency-preparedness/run-hide-fight/" target="_blank">police.illinois.edu/safe</a>. Remember you can sign up for emergency text messages at <a href="http://emergency.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">http://emergency.illinois.edu/</a>.</p>
