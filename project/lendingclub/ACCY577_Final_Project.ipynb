    "As an individual investor who is investing on the LendingClub platform, you want to understand how the individual components (i.e. features) of a loan, such as the amount loaned, the term length, loan grade or the interest rate, affect the profitablity of a specific loan. In particular, you are interested in understanding how likely a loan is to be repaid. In this project, you will use the provided loan dataset to build a model to help you pick up a profitable loan portfolio. \n"

    "## Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "You will work in groups to analyze the data to make recommendations based on the `lending_club_2007_2011_6_states.csv` dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will complete three tasks for this group project:\n",
    "1. A group report in the form of a Jupyter notebook,\n",
    "2. A video presentation where your group will present your results, and \n",
    "3. Peer evaluation of the contributions of each member of your group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final group report will be a single Jupyter notebook that will integrate Markdown, Python code, and the results from your code, such as data visualizations. Markdown cells should be used to explain any decisions you make regarding the data, to discuss any plots or visualizations generated in your notebook, and the results of your analysis. As a general guideline, the content should be written in a way that a fellow classmate (or an arbitrary data scientist/analyst) should be able to read your report and understand the results, implications, and processes that you followed to achieve your result.\n",
    "\n",
    "All group members should present in the video presentation. You can use presentation software such as MS PowerPoint. The presentations should cover the steps in your analytics process and highlight your results. You don't need to explain Python code in the presentation. Focus on your analysis method and results. The presentation should take between eight to twelve minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rubric\n",
    "  - Notebook report (160 points)\n",
    "  - Video presentation (100 points)\n",
    "  - Peer assessment for your groupmates (20 points) - You will get this 20 points as long as you submit peer evaluation before the deadline.\n",
    "  - Individual grade will be adjusted based on your peer evaluations by your group members.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Submissions\n",
    "- Each group:\n",
    "    - Report in .ipynb format\n",

    "- Each individual:\n",

    "### General\n",
    "\n",
    "Your report should \n",
    "  - Use proper markdown.  \n",
    "  - Include all of the code used for your analysis.\n",
    "  - Plots should be properly labeled (e.g., axis labels and titles).\n",
    "  - Use a consistent style.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Your presentation should\n",
    "  - Use clear, concise slides.\n",
    "  - Support your points with facts (e.g., statistics, visualizations).\n",
    "  - Avoid any coding details.\n",

    "#### Annual return\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculation of loan return is very complicated since the loan is paid by monthly installments. In this project, we simplify the calculation by using the total payment and funded amount. For charged-off loans, total payment collected includes post charged-off recoveries. So we can use following formula to calculate the total return:\n",

    "$TotalReturn = \\frac{Total Payment + recoveries}{Funded Amount} - 1$\n",

    "    The overall return doesn't reflect loan profitability since loans have different terms. It's more accurate to compare annual returns. There are only two terms in the dataset, 36 months and 60 months. The formula to calculate annual return is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Annualized Return = (1+Total Return)^{(1/years)} - 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if overall return of a 36 month loan is 10%, then annualized return = `(1 + 0.1)**(1/3) - 1` = `0.032`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this is not the true annualized return on a loan investment. But the goal of this project is to identify loans to invest, so we just need a benchmark to evaluate loan performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code cells, we first create total_return and annual_return for each loan, then we define a function to calculate annual return of a loan portfolio. The function calculates annual return for 36 month and 60 month loans in a portfolio separately. **Note:** You don't have to use this function in your project. You can define your own ways to evaluate profitability of a portfolio."
